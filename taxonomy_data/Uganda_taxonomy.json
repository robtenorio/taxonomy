Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade.

"para": "Improved social service delivery .  Much of Ugandas inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Governments primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on <span id = \"word\">Youth</span> <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Governments health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of <span id = \"word\">Land</span> <span id = \"word\">Tenure</span> and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \n \nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of <span id = \"word\">Land</span> registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-<span id = \"word\">Land</span> assets as collateral, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \n \nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of land registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-land assets as collateral, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.

"para": "Improved social service delivery .  Much of Ugandas inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Governments primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Governments health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water. In both health and education, the Bank will help the government support private sector provision of services. This objective contributes to SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10..

Mitigation of shocksby helping people who face them, and building up household and community assets, which increase resilience to shocks - is essential to stability and to reducing vulnerability.  \n \nThe Bank will support Uganda in expanding its system of safety nets, focused in particularly on the vulnerable Northern region, to help those already in poverty and those who have fallen back into poverty. It will also support those communities hosting refugees displaced from conflicts in neighboring countries, and help the government protect vulnerable groups through improved social risk management, including prevention of sexual and gender-based violence related to infrastructure development and public works, which accounts for a large share of WBG activities.

"para": "Improved social service delivery .  Much of Ugandas inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Governments primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span>, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Governments health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \n \nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of land registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-land assets as <span id = \"word\">Collateral</span>, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.
