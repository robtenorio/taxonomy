"para": "Improved social service delivery .  Much of Ugandas inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Governments primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on <span id = \"word\">Youth</span> <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Governments health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water. In both health and education, the Bank will help the government support private sector provision of services. This objective contributes to SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10..

Much of Uganda\\x92s inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Government\\x92s primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \\nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \\nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Government\\x92s health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water. In both health and education, the Bank will help the government support private sector provision of services. This objective contributes to SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10..

Growth in the agriculture sector requires higher agricultural productivity and increased commercialization, given the limited remaining potential for expansion of cultivated land, and the unpredictability of weather and prices. The WBG program takes a broad approach to boosting productivity and increasing commercialization, including interventions in many sectors that will encourage farmers to invest in their land. The program will tackle access to and security of land and access to finance so farmers have the capacity to invest. It will support improved extension services so farmers have the right information to invest and to adopt sustainable farming practices using high quality agricultural inputs. And it will help farmers capture economies of scale, including through associations and commercialization. The program will also help farmers get better prices, creating the incentive to invest. This will include strengthening value chain coordination in agribusiness and providing better price information and storage solutions so farmers can reduce post-harvest losses, sell when prices are attractive, and face lower transport costs to markets. As observed by the SCD, given current income levels, the high share of income going to consumption, and the relatively closed economy, an increase in income can produce large multiplier effects.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of <span id = \"word\">Land</span> tenure and <span id = \"word\">Acquisition</span> and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \\n \\nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of <span id = \"word\">Land</span> registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-<span id = \"word\">Land</span> assets as collateral, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.

Much of Uganda\\x92s inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Government\\x92s primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \\nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \\nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care. Bank support centers on strengthening health systems and infrastructure, improving incentives for health providers, and increasing the results focus of the Government\\x92s health programs. Other partners will focus their efforts on disease prevention, including for specific diseases and through more general approaches including hygiene and water. In both health and education, the Bank will help the government support private sector provision of services. This objective contributes to SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10..

Growth in the agriculture sector requires higher agricultural productivity and increased commercialization, given the limited remaining potential for expansion of cultivated land, and the unpredictability of weather and prices. The WBG program takes a broad approach to boosting productivity and increasing commercialization, including interventions in many sectors that will encourage farmers to invest in their land. The program will tackle access to and security of land and access to finance so farmers have the capacity to invest. It will support improved extension services so farmers have the right information to invest and to adopt sustainable farming practices using high quality agricultural inputs. And it will help farmers capture economies of scale, including through associations and commercialization. The program will also help farmers get better prices, creating the incentive to invest. This will include strengthening value chain coordination in agribusiness and providing better price information and storage solutions so farmers can reduce post-harvest losses, sell when prices are attractive, and face lower transport costs to markets. As observed by the SCD, given current income levels, the high share of income going to consumption, and the relatively closed economy, an increase in income can produce large multiplier effects.

Growth in the agriculture sector requires higher agricultural productivity and increased commercialization, given the limited remaining potential for expansion of cultivated land, and the unpredictability of weather and prices. The WBG program takes a broad approach to boosting productivity and increasing commercialization, including interventions in many sectors that will encourage farmers to invest in their land. The program will tackle access to and security of land and access to finance so farmers have the capacity to invest. It will support improved extension services so farmers have the right information to invest and to adopt sustainable farming practices using high quality agricultural inputs. And it will help farmers capture economies of scale, including through associations and commercialization. The program will also help farmers get better prices, creating the incentive to invest. This will include strengthening value chain coordination in agribusiness and providing better price information and storage solutions so farmers can reduce post-harvest losses, sell when prices are attractive, and face lower transport costs to markets. As observed by the SCD, given current income levels, the high share of income going to consumption, and the relatively closed economy, an increase in income can produce large multiplier effects. Key indicators are both yields and marketed volumes of selected crops. These will show both that farmers are producing more, and that they are receiving a return on their investment and labor by getting their product to market.

This requires four primary changes: (i) increasing revenues to expand the <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> space to finance infrastructure and social service needs; (ii) improving the allocation of resources both between sectors and levels of government; (iii) preparing for the effective management of future oil revenues and improving debt management; and (iv) enhancing expenditure management through improved PFM and procurement management. This needs to be complemented by strengthening country systems for transparency, participation and accountability. This objective contributes to SDGs 8, 10, and 16 (Annex 13). \n \nOn revenues and resource allocation; the Bank will support Uganda through a series of ASAs on revenue mobilization, including at the subnational level, and on efficiency of resource allocation, including poverty mapping and analysis to help target interventions to the poor. This will be supported by lending operations, including DPOs with strong sector content that will seek to improve resource allocation for service delivery to local governments and enhance transparency and accountability, to be complemented by a DPO/PforR series on revenue mobilization, strengthening institutions and policies for future oil management, and public expenditure efficiency. In addition, an investment project will focus on statistical capacity building, to close systematic gaps, as well as those within the priority areas covered by the CPF. On enhancing expenditure management the Bank will design a results based operation aimed at improving the use of public financial and procurement management systems; making budget planning and execution more transparent, reducing procurement delays while enhancing integrity respectively; and improving the sanctions regime. The operation will complement reforms supported under the current DPO series on <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> <span id = \"word\">Decentralization</span>, governance and service delivery and support interventions to enhance citizen engagement using social accountability mechanisms.

At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \\n \\nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of land registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-land assets as collateral, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.

Much of Ug<span id = \"word\">and</span>a\\x92s inclusive development in the short <span id = \"word\">and</span> longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant <span id = \"word\">and</span> productive participants in Ug<span id = \"word\">and</span>a society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, <span id = \"word\">and</span> skills. The Government\\x92s primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery <span id = \"word\">and</span> proper birth weight, early nutrition services <span id = \"word\">and</span> functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children <span id = \"word\">and</span> adults with skills <span id = \"word\">and</span> cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained <span id = \"word\">and</span> equitable economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>. \\nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable <span id = \"word\">and</span> many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North <span id = \"word\">and</span> East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, <span id = \"word\">and</span> focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual <span id = \"word\">and</span> gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in <span id = \"word\">and</span> out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to <span id = \"word\">and</span> quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression <span id = \"word\">and</span> retention of girls in secondary school to exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> their education <span id = \"word\">and</span> labor market opportunities <span id = \"word\">and</span> indirectly slow population <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> employers to deliver high-quality, dem<span id = \"word\">and</span>-driven training programs in priority sectors <span id = \"word\">and</span> likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ug<span id = \"word\">and</span>ans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \\nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) <span id = \"word\">and</span> under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective <span id = \"word\">and</span> inefficient deployment of human resources, medicines, equipment <span id = \"word\">and</span> <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span>. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional <span id = \"word\">and</span> able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, <span id = \"word\">and</span> furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage <span id = \"word\">and</span> quality of care.

The program will tackle access to and security of land and access to finance so farmers have the capacity to invest. It will support improved extension services so farmers have the right information to invest and to adopt sustainable farming practices using high quality agricultural inputs. And it will help farmers capture economies of scale, including through associations and commercialization. The program will also help farmers get better prices, creating the incentive to invest. This will include strengthening value chain coordination in agribusiness and providing better price information and storage solutions so farmers can reduce post-harvest losses, sell when prices are attractive, and face lower transport costs to markets. As observed by the SCD, given current income levels, the high share of income going to consumption, and the relatively closed economy, an increase in income can produce large multiplier effects.

Even as agricultural productivity increases, people in rural areas are increasingly vulnerable to long-term degradation of natural resources, droughts, and volatility in farm-gate prices. Indeed, in recent years, for every three people to rise out of poverty, two have fallen back into poverty. Mitigation of shocks\\x97by helping people who face them, and building up household and community assets, which increase resilience to shocks - is essential to stability and to reducing vulnerability.  \\n \\nThe Bank will support Uganda in expanding its system of safety nets, focused in particularly on the vulnerable Northern region, to help those already in poverty and those who have fallen back into poverty. It will also support those communities hosting refugees displaced from conflicts in neighboring countries, and help the government protect vulnerable groups through improved social risk management, including prevention of sexual and gender-based violence related to infrastructure development and public works, which accounts for a large share of WBG activities. In addition, the Bank will support social development dialogue and client capacity building to increase inclusion, sustainability, transparency and accountability in development-induced land acquisition.

Much of Ugandas inclusive development in the short and longer terms critically depends on helping people develop capacities to become self-reliant and productive participants in Uganda society. To seize opportunities people must have a basic level of health, knowledge, and skills. The Governments primary role in this process is to provide the foundations of primary services in health basic education. Heath services would include maternal health to ensure safe delivery and proper birth weight, early nutrition services and functional health centers. Basic education services would focus on providing children and adults with skills and cognitive development to tap into labor market opportunities. Addressing under-nutrition would help to improve productivity, reduce health care costs, and improve learning performance thereby contributing to sustained and equitable economic growth. \nIn primary education, access is nearly universal, but quality is variable and many students, particularly from poorer households, dropout before completion. Access to secondary education is limited, and financing remains inefficient. These shortcomings are particularly prominent in the North and East of the country. The Bank will continue to implement its investment in improving quality and equity of primary education by, among others, improving teacher effectiveness, school level accountability systems, and focusing on schools in rural areas, including measures to prevent sexual and gender-based violence (a common cause of school drop-outs amongst girls) against children both in and out of schools. A new project will focus on increasing access to and quality of secondary education. Of particular importance is progression and retention of girls in secondary school to expand their education and labor market opportunities and indirectly slow population growth. Finally, the Bank will continue ongoing work in skills development by supporting training institutions and employers to deliver high-quality, demand-driven training programs in priority sectors and likely introduce a new operation on youth employment to help Ugandans become more employable as the labor market evolves.  \nThe underlying challenges facing the health sector and constraining its performance arise from the high disease burden (the majority of which is preventable) and under-resourcing, coupled with ineffective and inefficient deployment of <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span>, medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Weaknesses in management, especially of the frontline services, where the majority of health facilities are not functional and able to deliver basic/essential health services particularly hamper delivery. As a result, coverage of several key programs is suboptimal, and furthermore, there is significant regional variation in coverage and quality of care.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \n \nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of land registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-land assets as <span id = \"word\">Collateral</span>, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services.

Growth in the agriculture sector requires higher agricultural productivity and increased commercialization, given the limited remaining potential for expansion of cultivated land, and the unpredictability of weather and prices. The WBG program takes a broad approach to boosting productivity and increasing commercialization, including interventions in many sectors that will encourage farmers to invest in their land. The program will tackle access to and security of land and access to finance so farmers have the capacity to invest. It will support improved extension services so farmers have the right information to invest and to adopt sustainable farming practices using high quality agricultural inputs. And it will help farmers capture economies of scale, including through associations and commercialization. The program will also help farmers get better prices, creating the incentive to invest. This will include strengthening value chain coordination in agribusiness and providing better price information and storage solutions so farmers can reduce post-harvest losses, sell when prices are attractive, and face lower transport costs to <span id = \"word\">Markets</span>. As observed by the SCD, given current income levels, the high share of income going to consumption, and the relatively closed economy, an increase in income can produce large multiplier effects. Key indicators are both yields and marketed volumes of selected crops. These will show both that farmers are producing more, and that they are receiving a return on their investment and <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> by getting their product to market. This objective contributes to SDGs 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. .

Even as agricultural productivity increases, people in rural areas are increasingly vulnerable to long-term degradation of natural resources, droughts, and volatility in farm-gate prices. Indeed, in recent years, for every three people to rise out of poverty, two have fallen back into poverty. Mitigation of shocks\\x97by helping people who face them, and building up household and community assets, which increase resilience to shocks - is essential to stability and to reducing vulnerability.  \\n \\nThe Bank will support Uganda in expanding its system of safety nets, focused in particularly on the vulnerable Northern region, to help those already in poverty and those who have fallen back into poverty. It will also support those communities hosting refugees displaced from conflicts in neighboring countries, and help the government protect vulnerable groups through improved social risk management, including prevention of sexual and gender-based violence related to infrastructure development and public works, which accounts for a large share of WBG activities. In addition, the Bank will support social development dialogue and client capacity building to increase inclusion, sustainability, transparency and accountability in development-induced land acquisition. For water for production, the Bank will support the government\\x92s development of integrated water resources management plans for key catchments and invest in monitoring and information systems for sustainable water flows and water for production including expanding the use of irrigation to mitigate against droughts.  \\n \\nInvestments in water for production will be made late in the CPF period, so results will only become apparent during the following CPF cycle.

Most new jobs in Uganda come from MSMEs, but they face a difficult business environment that creates a drag on job creation and disincentivizes formalization. At its base, improving the business environment to foster productive MSME growth and help new MSMEs enter the market, as well as encouraging larger businesses to invest, involves maintaining macro-economic stability and easing overly burdensome regulation on business while maintaining necessary rules and policies. But to invest, businesses need access to finance that comes with the certainty, transparency and accountability of land tenure and acquisition and resettlement policies, areas where WBG support will be key. They need security in the knowledge that their costs will be predictable due to a reliable and affordable supply of electricity and urban mobility, and that their outputs will find a market through regional transport links and lower barriers to trade. And they need a steady supply of healthy, educated, and skilled workers to produce their goods and services.  \\n \\nThe Bank and IFC will provide support in several of these areas: improving the coverage of land registration, expanding access to credit for MSMEs including through use of non-land assets as collateral, expanding the grid to make power more accessible, and supporting the development of demand-driven skills training and improvements in health and education services. The Bank will carry through its existing commitments in inter-city roads, but not provide new support, as other capable partners lead the dialogue there and the government has expressed greater demand in other areas. This objective contributes to SDGs 8 and 9. . Number of businesses with loans registered in the collateral registry      Baseline:  none (2015)     Target:      6,730, of which 15% are                      majority owned by                       women) (2021) Credit to the private sector (billion UGX)     Baseline:  6.63 (2014)     Target:      20.0 (2021)\", \n\"Improved access to urban services.  To sustainably accelerate its urbanization and maintain and improve living standards in urban areas, Uganda needs to prepare for migration to cities and small towns by strengthening the institutional capacity to develop implementable urban master plans to connect transport and services to land use as well as own source revenue mobilization. In terms of improving urban services, the Bank will focus its efforts on access to water and sanitation and electricity. The Bank also supports the government of Uganda is strengthening the land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation policy. Additional support may come in the form of analytical work on public transport options, laying the groundwork for future investments as well as technical assistance in selected areas such as strengthening capacity to deliver sanitation and manage fecal sludge. IFC will work opportunistically to make investments in banks to assist with the growth of mortgage products to improve access to housing. This objective contributes to SDGs 9, 11, and 16.

Even as agricultural productivity increases, people in rural areas are increasingly vulnerable to long-term degradation of natural resources, droughts, and volatility in farm-gate prices. Indeed, in recent years, for every three people to rise out of poverty, two have fallen back into poverty. Mitigation of shocksby helping people who face them, and building up household and community assets, which increase resilience to shocks - is essential to stability and to reducing vulnerability.  \n \nThe Bank will support Uganda in expanding its system of safety nets, focused in particularly on the vulnerable Northern region, to help those already in poverty and those who have fallen back into poverty.
