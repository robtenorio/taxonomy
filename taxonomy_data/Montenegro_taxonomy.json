Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and <span id = \"word\">Job</span>s.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020. Supporting the tourism value chain will generate <span id = \"word\">Job</span>s and growth of local suppliers and MSMEs supporting the tourism industry, including those in the agriculture sector, which itself accounts for around 8 percent of GDP.  \\xa0Increased private sector investments and <span id = \"word\">Job</span> creation in the areas of agriculture and sustainable tourism would substantially benefit rural communities and vulnerable groups, including women and youth. Agriculture is, by far, the largest source of income for the rural population, where 41 percent of the poor leave, and where inactivity rate for women reaches 67 percent, 27 percentage points higher than for men. \\n \\nMontenegro needs to invest in an inclusive growth model where the private sector serves as the engine of growth and provides employment opportunities for the country\\x92s labor force.   However, Montenegrin firms lack competitiveness: they are relatively poorly integrated into the global economy and are also less likely to adopt new technologies and to innovate.  Unlocking the potential for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (whose value added is estimated to account for about two thirds of GDP) to grow and become more competitive, is critical for Montenegro. The WBG will support the growth of innovation-driven and productivity-led MSMEs, to foster a dynamic and competitive private sector better positioned to generate growth and employment, through a <span id = \"word\">Job</span>s and Competitiveness Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\nThe WBG will use the comparative advantage of all its arms (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster employment in these areas. More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs\\x92 access to finance, business support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) \\xa0and addressing the business environment constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.\\xa0 IFC will also finance sustainable microfinance institutions to support economic opportunities and employment.

Work disincentives are highest for low-income earners or those in part-time work (the latter more likely to be women), and are very high for those receiving social assistance.  At the moment, in Montenegro it hardly pays off to have such a low-paying, part-time job within the formal sector. The main disincentives for formal work applies to single parents or single-earner couples with children who receive social assistance and family benefits (the child allowance). For these families, any part-time low-paying job would actually decrease net income. At the same time, employers are able to employ people informally, in particular for seasonal jobs, for example in the tourism industry, and thus prefer to rely on migrant workers from other countries, paying no taxes or social contributions, and sometimes observing no labor standards. This effectively creates a disincentive to employ the available local labor force, as well as having adverse implications for budget and <span id = \"word\">Pension</span> <span id = \"word\">Funds</span> revenues, in addition to putting these informal workers into a vulnerable position.  WBG will support strengthening incentives for work, including for poor and vulnerable groups, by focusing on disincentives in the social protection system, other barriers to activation, barriers related to information, perception, or labor and tax legislation, and strengthened regulation of the ¸æåì§ºgrey¸æå£§º economy to promote formalization of informal jobs.

Indicator 1: Stabilization of public debt Baseline: Public debt at 68 percent of GDP (2015) Target: After reaching its projected peak in 2018 (at 78 percent of GDP) public debt is reduced in 2019\", \n\"Increased stability and efficiency of financial sector .  The financial sector is an essential building block for maintaining Montenegro\\x92s macro stability and increasing efficiency in intermediating financial resources. However, Montenegro\\x92s financial sector is currently not fully equipped to play this role, on account of several inefficiencies identified under the 2015 IMF/World Bank FSAP. These include high costs of intermediation and high level of non-performing loans (NPLs). Growing risks and weaknesses in bank regulation and oversight also pose fiscal and financial stability risks.  \\n \\nWBG interventions will be outlined in the planned series of Fiscal and Financial Sector Resilience DPOs or PBGs. The planned FinSAC Deposit Protection Fund Strengthening TA Program will complement and further support this agenda, by focusing on strengthening the financial safety net.  IFC will continue supporting NPL resolution in the Western Balkans including in Montenegro.  Also, IFC will offer credit lines to local banks and microfinance institutions to support MSMEs, housing finance, renewable energy and agribusiness projects In addition to financing IFC will offer advisory services to the banks and microfinance institutions to enhance their risk management and governance practices. . Indicator 2: Reduction in the incidence of NPLs in total loan portfolio \\n \\nBaseline: NPL value of 14.7 % (Q3, 2015)  Target: NPL value of 10% (2019)  \\n \\n \\nIndicator 3: Strengthened prudential norms for identification, classification, and re-classification of nonperforming assets. \\n \\nBaseline: No amendment to CBM Decision on the minimum standards for management of credit risk (2015) Target:  Amendments adopted (2018)\", \n\"Enhanced private investments and job creation in high-potential sectors . Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and jobs.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020. Supporting the tourism value chain will generate jobs and growth of local suppliers and MSMEs supporting the tourism industry, including those in the agriculture sector, which itself accounts for around 8 percent of GDP.  \\xa0Increased private sector investments and job creation in the areas of agriculture and sustainable tourism would substantially benefit rural communities and vulnerable groups, including women and youth. Agriculture is, by far, the largest source of income for the rural population, where 41 percent of the poor leave, and where inactivity rate for women reaches 67 percent, 27 percentage points higher than for men. \\n \\nMontenegro needs to invest in an inclusive growth model where the private sector serves as the engine of growth and provides employment opportunities for the country\\x92s labor force.   However, Montenegrin firms lack competitiveness: they are relatively poorly integrated into the global economy and are also less likely to adopt new technologies and to innovate.  Unlocking the potential for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (whose value added is estimated to account for about two thirds of GDP) to grow and become more competitive, is critical for Montenegro. The WBG will support the growth of innovation-driven and productivity-led MSMEs, to foster a dynamic and competitive private sector better positioned to generate growth and employment, through a Jobs and Competitiveness Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\nThe WBG will use the comparative advantage of all its arms (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster employment in these areas. More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs\\x92 access to finance, business support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) \\xa0and addressing the business environment constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.\\xa0 IFC will also finance sustainable microfinance institutions to support economic opportunities and employment.

The financial sector is an essential building block for maintaining Montenegro\\x92s macro stability and increasing efficiency in intermediating financial resources. However, Montenegro\\x92s financial sector is currently not fully equipped to play this role, on account of several inefficiencies identified under the 2015 IMF/World Bank FSAP. These include high costs of intermediation and high level of non-performing loans (NPLs). Growing risks and weaknesses in bank regulation and oversight also pose fiscal and financial stability risks.  \\n \\nWBG interventions will be outlined in the planned series of Fiscal and Financial Sector Resilience DPOs or PBGs.

Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and jobs.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020.

Improving Montenegro\\x92s labor market performance and economic competitiveness will require a more skilled and better educated labor force, as well as increased knowledge and innovation. Montenegro faces a long-term issue of quality of education, reflected in poor performance of students. While access to education has improved, there is a challenging disconnect between the products of the education system and the private sector needs. On the medium-term, the challenge is to ensure that tertiary education students transition from school to work, but also that long-term unemployed are retrained and can thus re-enter the labor market.  \\n \\nWBG support under this objective will focus on building the right skills and supporting school-to-work transition for graduates of the education system (in particular, of higher education and technical and vocational education (TVET) students). In parallel, the ongoing Higher Education Research for Innovation and Competitiveness (HERIC) project continues to support reforms to improve higher education monitoring and service delivery, including in terms of financing and quality assurance, and to increase cooperation with the private sector through the establishment of a Center of Excellence that resulted in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups.

"para": "c(\"Increased alignment between skills and labor market demand  .  Improving Montenegro\\x92s labor market performance and economic competitiveness will require a more skilled and better educated labor force, as well as increased knowledge and innovation. Montenegro faces a long-term issue of quality of education, reflected in poor performance of students. While access to education has improved, there is a challenging disconnect between the products of the education system and the private sector needs. On the medium-term, the challenge is to ensure that tertiary education students transition from school to work, but also that long-term unemployed are retrained and can thus re-enter the labor market.  \\n \\nWBG support under this objective will focus on building the right skills and supporting school-to-work transition for graduates of the education system (in particular, of higher education and technical and vocational education (TVET) students). In parallel, the ongoing Higher Education Research for Innovation and Competitiveness (HERIC) project continues to support reforms to improve higher education monitoring and service delivery, including in terms of financing and quality assurance, and to increase cooperation with the private sector through the establishment of a Center of Excellence that resulted in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups.  These complementary activities will allow TVET and higher education to further improve its <span id = \"word\">Relationship</span> with the labor market and improve the transition from both VET and tertiary education to <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> for graduates. .

Disincentives for formal work are significant\\x97and in the case of recipients of social assistance prohibitively high. Work disincentives are highest for low-income earners or those in part-time work (the latter more likely to be women), and are very high for those receiving social assistance.  At the moment, in Montenegro it hardly pays off to have such a low-paying, part-time job within the formal sector. The main disincentives for formal work applies to single parents or single-earner couples with children who receive social assistance and family benefits (the child allowance). For these families, any part-time low-paying job would actually decrease net income. At the same time, employers are able to employ people informally, in particular for seasonal jobs, for example in the tourism industry, and thus prefer to rely on migrant workers from other countries, paying no taxes or social contributions, and sometimes observing no labor standards. This effectively creates a disincentive to employ the available local labor force, as well as having adverse implications for budget and pension funds revenues, in addition to putting these informal workers into a vulnerable position.  WBG will support strengthening incentives for work, including for poor and vulnerable groups, by focusing on disincentives in the social protection system, other barriers to activation, barriers related to information, perception, or labor and tax legislation, and strengthened regulation of the \\x91grey\\x92 economy to promote formalization of informal jobs.

More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs¸æå£§º access to finance, <span id = \"word\">Business</span> support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) ¸æåÜÑºand addressing the <span id = \"word\">Business</span> <span id = \"word\">Environment</span> constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and <span id = \"word\">Business</span> start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.¸æåÜÑº IFC will also finance sustainable microfinance institutions to support economic opportunities and employment. Indicator 8:   Private sector investments generated through IFC interventions and WB investments in tourism.  \n \nBaseline: 0 (2015) Target: US$30 million (2019) \n \nIndicator 9:  Increased share of jobs in Travel & Tourism (T&T) sector in non-coastal urban centers. \n \nBaseline: 9.7% (2014) Target: 12% (2019) \n \nIndicator 10: Increased investments in agricultural and rural development in line with IPARD measures \n \nBaseline: 0 commercially-oriented agro-holdings (2009) Target: 400 commercially-oriented  agro-holdings (2016)"

Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and jobs.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020. Supporting the tourism value chain will generate jobs and growth of local suppliers and MSMEs supporting the tourism industry, including those in the agriculture sector, which itself accounts for around 8 percent of GDP.  \\xa0Increased private sector investments and job creation in the areas of agriculture and sustainable tourism would substantially benefit rural communities and vulnerable groups, including women and youth. Agriculture is, by far, the largest source of income for the rural population, where 41 percent of the poor leave, and where inactivity rate for women reaches 67 percent, 27 percentage points higher than for men. \\n \\nMontenegro needs to invest in an inclusive growth model where the private sector serves as the engine of growth and provides employment opportunities for the country\\x92s labor force.   However, Montenegrin firms lack competitiveness: they are relatively poorly integrated into the global economy and are also less likely to adopt new technologies and to innovate.  Unlocking the potential for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (whose value added is estimated to account for about two thirds of GDP) to grow and become more competitive, is critical for Montenegro. The WBG will support the growth of innovation-driven and productivity-led MSMEs, to foster a dynamic and competitive private sector better positioned to generate growth and employment, through a Jobs and Competitiveness Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\nThe WBG will use the comparative advantage of all its arms (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster employment in these areas. More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs\\x92 access to finance, business support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) \\xa0and addressing the business environment constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.\\xa0 IFC will also finance sustainable microfinance institutions to support economic opportunities and employment.

Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and jobs.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020. Supporting the tourism value chain will generate jobs and growth of local suppliers and MSMEs supporting the tourism industry, including those in the agriculture sector, which itself accounts for around 8 percent of GDP.  \\xa0Increased private sector investments and job creation in the areas of agriculture and sustainable tourism would substantially benefit rural communities and vulnerable groups, including women and youth. Agriculture is, by far, the largest source of income for the rural population, where 41 percent of the poor leave, and where inactivity rate for women reaches 67 percent, 27 percentage points higher than for men. \\n \\nMontenegro needs to invest in an inclusive growth model where the private sector serves as the engine of growth and provides employment opportunities for the country\\x92s labor force.   However, Montenegrin firms lack competitiveness: they are relatively poorly integrated into the global economy and are also less likely to adopt new technologies and to innovate.  Unlocking the potential for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (whose value added is estimated to account for about two thirds of GDP) to grow and become more competitive, is critical for Montenegro. The WBG will support the growth of innovation-driven and productivity-led MSMEs, to foster a dynamic and competitive private sector better positioned to generate growth and employment, through a Jobs and Competitiveness Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\nThe WBG will use the comparative advantage of all its arms (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster employment in these areas. More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs\\x92 access to <span id = \"word\">Finance</span>, business support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) \\xa0and addressing the business environment constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.\\xa0 IFC will also <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> sustainable micro<span id = \"word\">Finance</span> institutions to support economic opportunities and employment.

Indicator 6:   Decrease in the average effective tax rate (AETR) of a low-income one earner couple (equivalent to half-time job at minimum wage) with two children on social assistance that moves from unemployment into a formal job.  \\n \\nBaseline: 93.3% (2011) Target:  80% (2019) \\n \\n \\nIndicator 7:  Percentage of unemployed registered with Public Employment Services finding formal employment. \\n \\nBaseline: 12.2%  (2015) Target: 20%  (2019)\", \n\"Enhanced private investments and job creation in high-potential sectors . Agriculture and Tourism are Montenegro\\x92s main economic sectors, with great potential to create income and jobs.  Tourism, the fastest growing economic sector in Montenegro, is a major source of employment and economic growth.  Over 18 percent of total employment in Montenegro was generated by the tourism industry in 2014, while foreign receipts from tourism service exports corresponded to 20 percent of GDP in the same year. The Government recognizes tourism and tourism-based local economy as priorities for the country, as reflected in the Montenegro Tourism Development Strategy to 2020. Supporting the tourism value chain will generate jobs and growth of local suppliers and MSMEs supporting the tourism industry, including those in the agriculture sector, which itself accounts for around 8 percent of GDP.  \\xa0Increased private sector investments and job creation in the areas of agriculture and sustainable tourism would substantially benefit rural communities and <span id = \"word\">Vulnerable</span> <span id = \"word\">Groups</span>, including women and youth. Agriculture is, by far, the largest source of income for the rural population, where 41 percent of the poor leave, and where inactivity rate for women reaches 67 percent, 27 percentage points higher than for men. \\n \\nMontenegro needs to invest in an inclusive growth model where the private sector serves as the engine of growth and provides employment opportunities for the country\\x92s labor force.   However, Montenegrin firms lack competitiveness: they are relatively poorly integrated into the global economy and are also less likely to adopt new technologies and to innovate.  Unlocking the potential for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (whose value added is estimated to account for about two thirds of GDP) to grow and become more competitive, is critical for Montenegro. The WBG will support the growth of innovation-driven and productivity-led MSMEs, to foster a dynamic and competitive private sector better positioned to generate growth and employment, through a Jobs and Competitiveness Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n \\nThe WBG will use the comparative advantage of all its arms (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA) to foster employment in these areas. More specifically, the WBG support would include: (i) fostering tourism-based local economy and sustainable development; (ii) supporting sustainable agriculture and rural development in line with the EU's pre-accession requirements; (iii)  supporting development of MSMEs through the firm lifecycle (increasing MSMEs\\x92 access to finance, business support services to improve internal capabilities of firms, and technology upgrading) \\xa0and addressing the business environment constraints that they face, starting with those engaged in the sustainable tourism agenda; (iv) facilitating access to ICT as a means to grow market access; (v) supporting increased cooperation with the private sector in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups; and (vi) promoting development of critical tourism-related infrastructure.\\xa0 IFC will also finance sustainable microfinance institutions to support economic opportunities and employment.

While access to education has improved, there is a challenging disconnect between the products of the education system and the private sector needs. On the medium-term, the challenge is to ensure that tertiary education students transition from school to work, but also that long-term unemployed are retrained and can thus re-enter the labor market.  \\n \\nWBG support under this objective will focus on building the right skills and supporting school-to-work transition for graduates of the education system (in particular, of higher education and technical and vocational education (TVET) students). In parallel, the ongoing Higher Education Research for Innovation and Competitiveness (HERIC) project continues to support reforms to improve higher education monitoring and service delivery, including in terms of financing and quality assurance, and to increase cooperation with the private sector through the establishment of a Center of Excellence that resulted in several international R&D partnerships and business start-ups.

Disincentives for formal work are significant\\x97<span id = \"word\">and</span> in the case of recipients of <span id = \"word\">Social</span> assistance prohibitively high. Work disincentives are highest for low-income earners or those in part-time work (the latter more likely to be women), <span id = \"word\">and</span> are very high for those receiving <span id = \"word\">Social</span> assistance.  At the moment, in Montenegro it hardly pays off to have such a low-paying, part-time job within the formal sector. The main disincentives for formal work applies to single parents or single-earner couples with children who receive <span id = \"word\">Social</span> assistance <span id = \"word\">and</span> family benefits (the child allowance). For these families, any part-time low-paying job would actually decrease net income. At the same time, employers are able to employ people informally, in particular for seasonal jobs, for example in the tourism industry, <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus prefer to rely on migrant workers from other countries, paying no taxes or <span id = \"word\">Social</span> contributions, <span id = \"word\">and</span> sometimes observing no <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards. This effectively creates a disincentive to employ the available local <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> force, as well as having adverse implications for budget <span id = \"word\">and</span> pension funds revenues, in addition to putting these informal workers into a vulnerable position.  WBG will support strengthening incentives for work, including for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups, by focusing on disincentives in the <span id = \"word\">Social</span> <span id = \"word\">Protection</span> system, other barriers to activation, barriers related to information, perception, or <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> tax legislation, <span id = \"word\">and</span> strengthened regulation of the \\x91grey\\x92 economy to promote formalization of informal jobs.
