Afghanistan has one of the lowest rates of electricity usage in the world (154 kWh person). While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with rural access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human development and welfare. There has been some progress in development of off-grid <span id = \"word\">Energy</span>, but much more is needed. The Doing Business Survey identified lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development; nearly half of all businesses are dependent on diesel generators. Afghanistan needs to generate more power from domestic as well as regional sources of <span id = \"word\">Energy</span>, and expand access to a wider share of the population. The CPF supports increased household and business access to affordable, sustainable, and reliable <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> supply by increasing <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> production, strengthening management capacity, and improving regional integration. The program will promote <span id = \"word\">Renewable</span> <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> and will ensure reduction in distribution losses.. 2.3.1 Generation of additional electricity through hydropower, gas, and <span id = \"word\">Renewable</span> <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> from domestic sources\\nBaseline (2016): 210 MW\\nTarget (2020): 335 MW\\n2.3.2 Increase in supply of grid connected electricity\\nBaseline (2016): 1,085 MW\\nTarget (2020): 1,800 MW (65 percent)\\n2.3.3 Increase in number of households with access to on-grid electricity\\nBaseline (2016): 1.2 million\\nTarget (2020): 1.68 million\\n2.3.4 By the end of 2020, a total of 20 MW of <span id = \"word\">Renewable</span> off-grid systems to supply a minimum service standard of 100 Watts per household.\\nYear 1 baseline: 3MW\", \n\"Improved regulatory environment for extractive industries. Although Afghanistan is endowed with a wide range of minerals and hydrocarbons, the sector currently makes a limited contribution to growth, revenue generation, or employment despite past support. Governance challenges remain, and the recent commodity price slump has dampened private sector investment. There is a need over a medium-term framework to improve the policy and regulatory capacity and provide \\x91proof of concept\\x92 investments that would test the governance and regulatory regime for mining and gas, and from which successful operations would then be incrementally grown. The World Bank Group will support creation of an enabling environment by supporting improvement in policies, regulatory capacity, and infrastructure for transparent and sustainable development of the extractive sector as a future driver of broader development and growth.. 2.5.1 Regulatory regime for extractive industries developed and being implemented by 2020.\\n2016: In preparation\\n2020 Agreed and operational\\n2.5.2 Value of resource corridor related PPP/private investments transactions developed\\nBaseline (2016): 0\\nTarget (2020): $10 million\"\n)"

The CPF aims at increasing access to electricity for households, businesses, and public services through additional power generation. Afghanistan has one of the lowest rates of electricity usage in the world (154 kWh person). While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with rural access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human development and welfare. There has been some progress in development of off-grid energy, but much more is needed. The Doing Business Survey identified lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development; nearly half of all businesses are dependent on diesel generators. Afghanistan needs to generate more power from domestic as well as regional sources of energy, and expand access to a wider share of the population. The CPF supports increased household and business access to affordable, sustainable, and reliable energy supply by increasing energy production, strengthening management capacity, and improving regional integration.

While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with <span id = \"word\">Rural</span> access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human <span id = \"word\">Development</span> and welfare.

The CPF aims at increasing access to electricity for households, businesses, and public services through additional power generation. Afghanistan has one of the lowest rates of electricity usage in the world (154 kWh person). While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with rural access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human development and welfare. There has been some progress in development of off-grid energy, but much more is needed. The Doing Business Survey identified lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development; nearly half of all businesses are dependent on diesel generators. Afghanistan needs to generate more power from domestic as well as <span id = \"word\">Regional</span> sources of energy, and expand access to a wider share of the population. The CPF supports increased household and business access to affordable, sustainable, and reliable energy supply by increasing energy production, strengthening management capacity, and improving <span id = \"word\">Regional</span> <span id = \"word\">Integration</span>. The program will promote renewable energy and will ensure reduction in distribution losses.. 2.3.1 Generation of additional electricity through hydropower, gas, and renewable energy from domestic sources\\nBaseline (2016): 210 MW\\nTarget (2020): 335 MW\\n2.3.2 Increase in supply of grid connected electricity\\nBaseline (2016): 1,085 MW\\nTarget (2020): 1,800 MW (65 percent)\\n2.3.3 Increase in number of households with access to on-grid electricity\\nBaseline (2016): 1.2 million\\nTarget (2020): 1.68 million\\n2.3.4 By the end of 2020, a total of 20 MW of renewable off-grid systems to supply a minimum service standard of 100 Watts per household.\\nYear 1 baseline: 3MW\"\n)"

The CPF aims at increasing access to electricity for households, businesses, and public services through additional power generation. Afghanistan has one of the lowest rates of electricity usage in the world (154 kWh person). While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with rural access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human development and welfare. There has been some progress in development of <span id = \"word\">Off-Grid</span> energy, but much more is needed. The Doing Business Survey identified lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development; nearly half of all businesses are dependent on diesel generators. Afghanistan needs to generate more power from domestic as well as regional sources of energy, and expand access to a wider share of the population. The CPF supports increased household and business access to affordable, sustainable, and reliable energy supply by increasing energy production, strengthening management capacity, and improving regional integration. The program will promote renewable energy and will ensure reduction in distribution losses.. 2.3.1 Generation of additional electricity through <span id = \"word\">Hydropower</span>, gas, and renewable energy from domestic sources\nBaseline (2016): 210 MW\nTarget (2020): 335 MW\n2.3.2 Increase in supply of grid connected electricity\nBaseline (2016): 1,085 MW\nTarget (2020): 1,800 MW (65 percent)\n2.3.3 Increase in number of households with access to on-grid electricity\nBaseline (2016): 1.2 million\nTarget (2020): 1.68 million\n2.3.4 By the end of 2020, a total of 20 MW of renewable <span id = \"word\">Off-Grid</span> systems to supply a minimum service standard of 100 Watts per household.\nYear 1 baseline: 3MW"
