The program will promote renewable energy and will ensure reduction in distribution losses.. 2.3.1 Generation of additional electricity through hydropower, gas, and renewable energy from domestic sources\nBaseline (2016): 210 MW\nTarget (2020): 335 MW\n2.3.2 Increase in supply of grid connected electricity\nBaseline (2016): 1,085 MW\nTarget (2020): 1,800 MW (65 percent)\n2.3.3 Increase in number of households with access to on-grid electricity\nBaseline (2016): 1.2 million\nTarget (2020): 1.68 million\n2.3.4 By the end of 2020, a total of 20 MW of renewable off-grid systems to supply a minimum service standard of 100 Watts per household.\nYear 1 baseline: 3MW"

The CPF aims at increasing access to electricity for households, businesses, and public services through additional power generation. Afghanistan has one of the lowest rates of electricity usage in the world (154 kWh person). While overall access to grid-powered electricity is 30 percent, there are wide disparities, with rural access rates averaging only 11 percent; lack of electricity access for schools, health facilities, and homes impedes human development and welfare. There has been some progress in development of <span id = \"word\">Off-Grid</span> energy, but much more is needed. The Doing Business Survey identified lack of electricity as a critical constraint to business development; nearly half of all businesses are dependent on diesel generators. Afghanistan needs to generate more power from domestic as well as regional sources of energy, and expand access to a wider share of the population.
