Tourism is central to private sector economic activity in several of the PIC9 countries. Tourism, as a service sector\\nwith relatively low entry barriers and its supply chain stimulates demand for domestic produce, local artwork and\\nhandicrafts. It is labor?intensive and sup<span id = \"word\">Ports</span> significant domestic job creation and is one of the few industries in\\nthe Pacific in which women and young people form a high percentage of job holders. For young people, especially\\nthose who are unskilled, tourism is a potential pathway to productive employment. It is the cause of significant\\ninfrastructure demand, providing a rationale for increased investment into airport, port and road infrastructure\\nwithout which the industry cannot flourish. Regional approaches would help enhance air access and the marketing\\nof Pacific island destinations in new markets such as Asia. Cruise shipping has the potential to offer benefits\\nthrough greater local linkages, especially in the South Pacific.. Expanded tourism opportunities\\nChange in tourist (non-resident) international\\narrivals both air and cruise tourism. Indicative\\nVanuatu:\\nBaseline 108,000 Target 130,000\\nSamoa:\\nBaseline 131,000 Target 145,000\", \n\"Increased access to basic services and improved connective infrastructure. Disparities in basic services \\x96 spanning access to water and sanitation to electricity and information and\\ncommunication technologies \\x96 are particularly pronounced among the PICs. In some PICs in particular, services\\nare often limited to the main islands, while the outer islands, where most of the poor reside, have very limited\\naccess. Given the high cost of providing services to populations in remote islands, it is important to close gaps in\\nservice provision wherever this is feasible and economical.\\nIn order to support progress against both of the twin goals, infrastructure coverage gaps need to be addressed;\\nmuch of the population in countries such as Vanuatu, Kiribati, and FSM lack access to basic services like\\nsanitation facilities and electricity. Land transport infrastructure on larger outer islands and outer?island shipping\\nservices also need to meet a basic standard. The efficacy of domestic shipping services is quite variable around the\\nregion, and it is a priority to address market failures which result in rural areas being cut off by high?cost,\\ninfrequent or sporadic shipping services. Improved connectivity and better infrastructure will be critical to help\\nadvance the well-being of the people of the Pacific and their access to growth. The most important connectivity\\nimprovement for the air tourism sector is to create more convenient flight connections from key markets..\"\n)"
