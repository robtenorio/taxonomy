They would potentially include PPPs and outsourcing through performance-based contracts. IFC will explore opportunities to support this agenda through the transaction advisory, financing of pilot PPP projects and creditworthy SOEs, and advice on development of the regulatory framework for PPPs.   IFC will be also interested to support critical private <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span> projects, including in the oil and gas sector and telecommunications through debt and equity finance.

The Government is implementing the third State Program of Social and Economic <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of Regions for 20142018  which aims at reducing regional inequalities and providing households in all rayon centers with reliable basic services, such as water and sanitation, gas, electricity, heating, decent housing and waste collection. Inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services are also identified by the SCD as challenges that impede inclusive growth and asset accumulation, especially by Bottom-40 who mostly reside outside the capital city and mainly in rural area. In particular, the SCD highlights a need for investing in water and sanitation as part of the public health infrastructure as well as in connectivity as a way to influence people\\x92s demand for health and education services.   \\n \\nThe WBG will maximize impact of its intervention using the accumulated experience and lessons of the long term engagement in infrastructure. \\n \\nApplying the selectivity filters, the WBG program will contribute to: i) improving access to utilities and local and community infrastructure through community-driven infrastructure investments in the poor communities,  ii) expanding coverage and accessibility of water and sanitation services,  iii) improving management of  solid waste in  Greater Baku Area and the <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of a National Solid Waste Management Strategy, and iv) developing institutional capacity of  the state companies in charge of water and sanitation, as key element of strengthening governance and ensuring sustainability of investments into the sectors. In particular, to address regional disparities, the program will  continue  improve  water supply and sanitation in rayons with a relatively  higher level of poverty incidence, for example in the south (e.g. Masally, Lerik, Yardimly) and in the north (e.g. Siyazan, Shabran) of Azerbaijan. Through infrastructure investments in poor communities, program will help improve connectivity which eventually would connect people to markets, health and education facilities, and markets to markets. \\n \\nIFC will explore PPP and investment opportunities in areas such as solid waste and power distribution, and will be open to provide advisory services on loss reduction and investment optimization to state utilities in the energy sector. .

SCD defines the legacy pollution and governance gaps in environmental management as exposing the poorest - especially those who reside close to oil fields, abandoned industrial sites and rural areas- to health risks. Land and water contamination and lack of a time bound strategy to promote environmental sustainability also limits opportunities for sustainable economic activities and entrepreneurship.  Government pursues the following goals: (i) to clean-up the polluted areas of the Absheron peninsula, including lakes and contaminated areas around Sumgayit; (ii) achieve zero routine flaring by 2030; and (iii) address gaps in waste management and cleanup oil spills along the transport routes.  \\n \\nThe WBG supports the Government\\x92s efforts in reducing gas flaring in partnership with government and oil companies operating in the country. Given its global knowledge and expertise, the WBG will contribute to the Government\\x92s ongoing Absheron Lake Clean-Up Program aimed at mitigating the adverse impact on health and economic opportunities.

The Government aspires to create an environment conducive for the private sector development as measured by gains in the Doing Business scorecard and World Competitiveness Index.  The most problematic areas as per the Doing Business rating include Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting <span id = \"word\">Electricity</span> and Trading across Borders. Some of the broader underlining constraints behind these poor ratings include (i) excessive burden of business regulations (e.g., permits, inspections, tax administration), and (ii) low transparency of importexport customs operations. SMEs face an uneven burden of these distortions vis a vis SOEs and large conglomerates. Therefore, the WBG interventions in this area will target SMEs. The WBG program will aim to address some of the above constraints through the ongoing IFCs advisory support and IBRD investment operations. IFC will continue efforts aimed at (i) the streamlining business inspections and issuance of business permits (e.g., introduction of e-services and roll-out risk based inspections), and (ii) simplification of tax policies and administration procedures. These efforts will be complemented by the ongoing IBRD Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project which helps improve <span id = \"word\">Access</span>, transparency and efficiency of delivery of selected justice services including for businesses.

The Government aspires to create an environment conducive for the private sector development as measured by gains in the Doing Business scorecard and World Competitiveness Index.  The most problematic areas as per the Doing Business rating include Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting Electricity and Trading across Borders. Some of the broader underlining constraints behind these poor ratings include (i) excessive burden of business regulations (e.g., permits, inspections, tax administration), and (ii) low transparency of importexport customs operations. SMEs face an uneven burden of these distortions vis a vis SOEs and large conglomerates. Therefore, the WBG interventions in this area will target SMEs. The WBG program will aim to address some of the above constraints through the ongoing IFC\\x92s advisory support and IBRD investment operations. IFC will continue efforts aimed at (i) the streamlining business inspections and issuance of business permits (e.g., introduction of e-services and roll-out risk based inspections), and (ii) simplification of tax policies and administration procedures. These efforts will be complemented by the ongoing IBRD Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project which helps improve access, transparency and efficiency of delivery of selected justice services including for businesses. Should the opportunity arise, the WBG will be open to help the government address other problematic areas of the regulatory environment, including ongoing efforts to improve customs procedures through the digitalization of trade processes..

The Government aspires to create an environment conducive for the private sector development as measured by gains in the Doing Business scorecard and World Competitiveness Index.  The most problematic areas as per the Doing Business rating include Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting Electricity and Trading across Borders. Some of the broader underlining constraints behind these poor ratings include (i) excessive burden of business regulations (e.g., permits, inspections, tax administration), and (ii) low transparency of importexport customs operations. SMEs face an uneven burden of these distortions vis a vis SOEs and large conglomerates. Therefore, the WBG interventions in this area will target SMEs. The WBG program will aim to address some of the above constraints through the ongoing IFC\\x92s advisory support and IBRD investment operations. IFC will continue efforts aimed at (i) the streamlining business inspections and issuance of business permits (e.g., introduction of e-services and roll-out risk based inspections), and (ii) simplification of tax policies and administration procedures. These efforts will be complemented by the ongoing IBRD Judicial Services and Smart Infrastructure Project which helps improve access, transparency and efficiency of delivery of selected justice services including for businesses. Should the opportunity arise, the WBG will be open to help the government address other problematic areas of the regulatory environment, including ongoing efforts to improve customs procedures through the digitalization of trade processes..

The Government is implementing the third State Program of Social and Economic Development of Regions for 20142018  which aims at reducing regional inequalities and providing households in all rayon centers with reliable basic services, such as water and sanitation, gas, electricity, heating, decent housing and waste collection. Inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services are also identified by the SCD as challenges that impede inclusive growth and asset accumulation, especially by Bottom-40 who mostly reside outside the capital city and mainly in rural area.

SCD defines the legacy pollution and governance gaps in environmental management as exposing the poorest - especially those who reside close to oil fields, abandoned industrial sites and rural areas- to health risks. Land and water contamination and lack of a time bound strategy to promote environmental sustainability also limits opportunities for sustainable economic activities and entrepreneurship.  Government pursues the following goals: (i) to clean-up the polluted areas of the Absheron peninsula, including lakes and contaminated areas around Sumgayit; (ii) achieve zero routine flaring by 2030; and (iii) address gaps in waste management and cleanup oil spills along the transport routes.  \\n \\nThe WBG supports the Government\\x92s efforts in reducing gas flaring in partnership with government and oil companies operating in the country.

Effective service delivery is identified by the SCD as a key priority along with strengthened rule of law and reliable data on public service delivery.

The SCD highlights the need for improved connectivity as fundamental for Azerbaijan\\x92s transformation into a diversified economy with significant value addition of a modern non-oil sector. The main transport corridors are important routes for producers to reach out to both local <span id = \"word\">and</span> international markets in a faster <span id = \"word\">and</span> cheaper way while development of local roads is critical for increased access to markets for producers in rural areas, where majority of Bottom-40 reside.  \\n \\nWith the support of development partners (ADB, EBRD, KfW, JICA), the country has considerably invested in the development of road infrastructure, mainly highways <span id = \"word\">and</span> international transport corridors <span id = \"word\">and</span> intends to complete this agenda with their participation in the medium term. It also wants to ensure sustainability of the high volume investments by establishing a proper maintenance systems to be expectedly led by the WBG.

The Government is implementing the third State Program of Social and Economic Development of Regions for 20142018  which aims at reducing regional inequalities and providing households in all rayon centers with reliable basic services, such as water and sanitation, gas, electricity, heating, decent housing and waste collection. Inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services are also identified by the SCD as challenges that impede inclusive growth and asset accumulation, especially by Bottom-40 who mostly reside outside the capital city and mainly in rural area. In particular, the SCD highlights a need for investing in water and sanitation as part of the public health infrastructure as well as in connectivity as a way to influence people\\x92s demand for health and education services.   \\n \\nThe WBG will maximize impact of its intervention using the accumulated experience and lessons of the long term engagement in infrastructure. \\n \\nApplying the selectivity filters, the WBG program will contribute to: i) improving access to utilities and local and community infrastructure through community-driven infrastructure investments in the poor communities,  ii) expanding coverage and accessibility of water and sanitation services,  iii) improving management of  solid waste in  Greater Baku Area and the development of a National Solid Waste Management Strategy, and iv) developing institutional capacity of  the state companies in charge of water and sanitation, as key element of strengthening governance and ensuring sustainability of investments into the sectors. In particular, to address regional disparities, the program will  continue  improve  water supply and sanitation in rayons with a relatively  higher level of poverty incidence, for example in the south (e.g. Masally, Lerik, Yardimly) and in the north (e.g. Siyazan, Shabran) of Azerbaijan.

The government recognizes agriculture sector\\x92s high potential for boosting non-oil growth, ensuring food security and providing jobs and income opportunities for about 40 percent of the country\\x92s population who live in rural areas.  The national Strategy for Agriculture Development outlines the main directions for unleashing this potential. The SCD also prioritizes agriculture and agribusinesses as a means to stimulate rural incomes and consumption growth and, thereby, boost shared prosperity. There is a need to fill in gaps in irrigation, introduce new technologies, improve access to finance and essential logistics, as well as develop a quality infrastructure to enhance the export potential of agricultural produce. To complete the circuit, the government continues to work on protection of land property rights through expansion of the cadaster system and increased efficiency of services. The WBG will continue to contribute to the sector development by focusing on selected value chains, expanding access to investment financing, and strengthening animal health and phytosanitary services as key elements of the quality infrastructure. With other development partners (KfW), the WBG will help improve the system of property rights registration. To enable better access to markets and more productive use of assets by rural population, the WBG program will also contribute to the development of auxiliary infrastructure, such as local roads, irrigation systems, storage facilities and extension services.  \\n .

The Government is implementing the third State Program of Social and Economic Development of Regions for 20142018  which aims at reducing regional inequalities and providing households in all rayon centers with reliable basic services, such as water and sanitation, gas, electricity, heating, decent housing and waste collection. Inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services are also identified by the SCD as challenges that impede inclusive growth and asset accumulation, especially by Bottom-40 who mostly reside outside the capital city and mainly in rural area. In particular, the SCD highlights a need for investing in water and sanitation as part of the public health infrastructure as well as in connectivity as a way to influence peoples demand for health and education services.   \n \nThe WBG will maximize impact of its intervention using the accumulated experience and lessons of the long term engagement in infrastructure. \n \nApplying the selectivity filters, the WBG program will contribute to: i) improving access to utilities and <span id = \"word\">Local</span> and community infrastructure through community-driven infrastructure investments in the poor communities,  ii) expanding coverage and accessibility of water and sanitation services,  iii) improving management of  solid waste in  Greater Baku Area and the development of a National Solid Waste Management Strategy, and iv) developing institutional capacity of  the state companies in charge of water and sanitation, as key element of strengthening <span id = \"word\">Governance</span> and ensuring sustainability of investments into the sectors.
