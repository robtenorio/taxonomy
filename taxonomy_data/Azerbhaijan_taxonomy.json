The most problematic areas as per the Doing Business rating include Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting Electricity and Trading across Borders.

SMEs face an uneven burden of these distortions vis a vis SOEs and large conglomerates. Therefore, the WBG interventions in this area will target SMEs. The WBG program will aim to address some of the above constraints through the ongoing IFCs advisory support and IBRD investment operations. IFC will continue efforts aimed at (i) the streamlining business inspections and issuance of business permits (e.g., introduction of e-services and roll-out risk based inspections), and (ii) simplification of tax policies and administration procedures.

The Government is implementing the third State Program of Social and Economic Development of Regions for 20142018  which aims at reducing regional inequalities and providing households in all rayon centers with reliable basic services, such as <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span>, gas, electricity, heating, decent housing and waste collection. Inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services are also identified by the SCD as challenges that impede inclusive growth and asset accumulation, especially by Bottom-40 who mostly reside outside the capital city and mainly in rural area. In particular, the SCD highlights a need for investing in <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span> as part of the public health infrastructure as well as in connectivity as a way to influence peoples demand for health and education services.   \n \nThe WBG will maximize impact of its intervention using the accumulated experience and lessons of the long term engagement in infrastructure. \n \nApplying the selectivity filters, the WBG program will contribute to: i) improving access to utilities and local and community infrastructure through community-driven infrastructure investments in the poor communities,  ii) expanding coverage and accessibility of <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span> services,  iii) improving management of  solid waste in  Greater Baku Area and the development of a National Solid Waste Management Strategy, and iv) developing institutional capacity of  the state companies in charge of <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span>, as key element of strengthening <span id = \"word\">Governance</span> and ensuring sustainability of investments into the sectors. In particular, to address regional disparities, the program will  continue  improve  <span id = \"word\">Water</span> <span id = \"word\">Supply</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span> in rayons with a relatively  higher level of poverty incidence, for example in the south (e.g. Masally, Lerik, Yardimly) and in the north (e.g. Siyazan, Shabran) of Azerbaijan. Through infrastructure investments in poor communities, program will help improve connectivity which eventually would connect people to markets, health and education facilities, and markets to markets. \n \nIFC will explore PPP and investment opportunities in areas such as solid waste and power distribution, and will be open to provide advisory services on loss reduction and investment optimization to state utilities in the energy sector. . Indicator 1:  Increased number of households in WBG program areas receiving potable <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span> services  \n \nBaseline: 40000  (2014) Target:  60000     (2017) \n \nIndicator 2:  Number of rayons in WBG program areas with adequate Operational and Maintenance (O&M) capacity \nBaseline: 5  (2014) Target: 12   (2017) \n \nIndicator 3: Waste management in Greater Baku (landfilling and recycling) in line with EU waste management and landfilling directives \n \nBaseline: Not in line with EU directives (2015) \n \nTarget: Fully in line with EU directives (2020) \n \n \n \nIndicator 4: Improved access to key facilities as measured by reduced time spent by beneficiaries in supported communities to reach the market, hospital, school, safe <span id = \"word\">Water</span> source, etc. \n \nBaseline: 15% on average (2014)  Target:   48%  on average  (2018)"
