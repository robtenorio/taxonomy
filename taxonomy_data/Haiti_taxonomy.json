A multi-pronged approach is recommended by the SCD to enhance income opportunities.  This approach focuses on creating jobs and supporting private sector actors through public and private investment in off and on farm activities, while removing key infrastructure bottlenecks to market access.  Outside of Port au Prince, WBG interventions will support smaller actors in the <span id = \"word\">Agricultural</span> and tourism sectors through grants and know-how, and invest in connectivity and market infrastructure in a key <span id = \"word\">Agricultural</span> area, removing some of the key barriers to markets faced by farmers and non-farm economic actors in that region, and increase access to <span id = \"word\">Finance</span>.  These interventions aim to support entrepreneurship, generate greater opportunities, improve incomes, and remove key constraints identified by the SCD in specific environments.  IFC will continue to seek opportunities to contribute to employment and economic growth with sizable companies in the manufacturing and services sector as well as new sectors that are underserved such as infrastructure. .

The cholera activities under the health project includes training of medical personnel, treatment, prevention education, and continue to build capacity in surveillance. The water project will increase access to clear water and improved sanitation in the 16 priority communes and build capacity in the water authority for planning, budget, and manage the sector and improve the coordination of disease surveillance between Haiti and the DR. 7.1 Case-Fatality Ratio for hospitalized cholera cases Baseline: 1% (May/June 2015) Target:  <1%  (2018/2019)\\n7.2 Number of people with access to improved water & sanitation Baseline: 0 (2015) Target: 241,000 (2019)\", \n\"Improve Disaster Prevention and Strengthen <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> Resilience .
