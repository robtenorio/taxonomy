Providing women farmers with better access to\nagricultural services and infrastructure, and developing technologies that are gender sensitive will likely have direct pay-offs for nutritional\noutcomes in agricultural production. Under GTP II, the GoE has articulated a policy on agricultural <span id = \"word\">Development</span>-led industrialization, aimed\nat increasing agricultural productivity, with efforts to expand this policy to agribusiness <span id = \"word\">Development</span> and incentives for private investment.\nThe WBG program of investments in productivity improvements is supporting improved public services for crop and livestock producers,\nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of value chains and marketing services. Productivity gains among smallholder\nlivestock producers will result in a reduction of GHG emissions per unit of product, thus contributing to achieving the communicated\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC). IFC will continue building its portfolio in agriculture to improve access of livestock smallholder\nproducers and processors to quality inputs which includes support to reforms on licenses and permit requirements for key livestock inputs.\nMIGA will continue to explore expansion of its current portfolio in the agribusiness sector to support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct\ninvestment into the sector in Ethiopia..

In the\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya could\nboost Ethiopias annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis and policy advice. In the energy sector, the WB is supporting the development\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a renewable energy guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions and preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, and\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\nborrowing; and a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2. As highlighted in GTP II, Ethiopia has decided to introduce PPP\nfinancing for investments in infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),\nand WBG are working together to support GoE in preparing a PPP Framework, establishing a PPP Unit, developing detailed implementation\nprocedures, and identifying/developing future projects. This will help to develop Ethiopias framework for PPPs and build the requisite\ncapacity to boost private investment in infrastructure and other sectors.

The WBG, through the Competitiveness and Job Creation\nProject, is helping to address the constraints to industrial zone development, investor promotion and industrial zone infrastructure. The\nforthcoming National Quality Infrastructure Development Project will support improvements in Ethiopias national infrastructure through\ndelivery of quality assurance services to enterprises.

The WBG has launched a series\nof interventions supporting the GoEs objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing Innovation for Financial\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting Inclusive Insurance Project is supporting access to insurance services of quality, value and safety for\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\nregime); and address SMEs bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\ncomplements the ongoing Women Entrepreneurship Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small enterprises.\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\nregime); and address SMEs bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development.

First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, and recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\nshows that the Governments safety net programs reduce poverty and protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\nreach all in need and require sustained <span id = \"word\">Public</span> financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, and informal safety nets\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor and vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly and disabled; (ii) high levels\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long and costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; and (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\nespecially for women and youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, and more likely to work in less skilled,\ninformal and lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security and Job Creation Strategy to\nreduce poverty and vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Governments safety net in rural areas,\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; and (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers and livelihood support, and indirectly through the <span id = \"word\">Public</span>\n<span id = \"word\">Works</span> that aim to transform the natural environment and invest in rural infrastructure.

"para": "Improved sustainability and effectiveness of safety nets. Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, and recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\nshows that the Governments safety net programs reduce poverty and protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\nreach all in need and require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, and informal safety nets\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor and vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly and disabled; (ii) high levels\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long and costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; and (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\nespecially for women and youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, and more likely to work in less skilled,\ninformal and lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security and Job Creation Strategy to\nreduce poverty and vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Governments safety net in rural areas,\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; and (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers and livelihood support, and indirectly through the public\nworks that aim to transform the <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> environment and invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households and access to livelihood opportunities..

IFC will also pursue investments to support private\nsector <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation. Based on government demand the World Bank team will\nsupport additional technical analysis during the CPF period. Limited access to credit for private investment is a binding constraint to the <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> and competitiveness of firms, particularly Micro, Small\nand Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -disproportionately for women-owned firms- and is a priority of GTP II. The WBG has launched a series\nof interventions supporting the GoEs objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing <span id = \"word\">Innovation</span> for Financial\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting Inclusive Insurance Project is supporting access to insurance services of quality, value and safety for\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\nregime); and address SMEs bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\ncomplements the ongoing Women Entrepreneurship Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small enterprises.\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human <span id = \"word\">Development</span> indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human <span id = \"word\">Development</span> Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\nchild education.\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors.

Ethiopia needs new approaches to finance infrastructure through measures such as boosting tax revenues, increased private sector\ninvolvement (including PPPs), greater selectivity and prioritization of investments, and improved public investment management. In the\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya could\nboost Ethiopias annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis and policy advice. In the energy sector, the WB is supporting the development\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a renewable energy guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions and preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, and\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\nborrowing; and a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2. As highlighted in GTP II, Ethiopia has decided to introduce PPP\nfinancing for investments in infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),\nand WBG are working together to support GoE in preparing a PPP Framework, establishing a PPP Unit, developing detailed implementation\nprocedures, and identifying/developing future projects. This will help to develop Ethiopias framework for PPPs and build the requisite\ncapacity to boost private investment in infrastructure and other sectors. The WBG will work with GoE to leverage private financial resources\nto help close the infrastructure gap, and IFC will explore PPPs in infrastructure. Indicator 1: Debt Management capacity\nincreased\nBaseline: Government does not conduct\nand publish annual DSAs in compliance\nwith international practice (2016)\nTarget: Government conducts and\npublishes annual DSAs in full compliance\nwith international practice (2021)\nIndicator 2: PPP project agreements /IPPs,\nconsistent with PPP framework, signed\n(number)\nBaseline: 0 (2016)\nTarget: 5 (2021)"

First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as <span id = \"word\">Drought</span>, and recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\nshows that the Governments safety net programs reduce poverty and protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\nreach all in need and require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, and informal safety nets\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor and vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly and disabled; (ii) high levels\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long and costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; and (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\nespecially for women and youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, and more likely to work in less skilled,\ninformal and lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the <span id = \"word\">Drought</span>-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security and Job Creation Strategy to\nreduce poverty and vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Governments safety net in rural areas,\nincluding responsiveness to <span id = \"word\">Drought</span> induced food insecurity; and (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers and livelihood support, and indirectly through the public\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment and invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households and access to livelihood opportunities..

"para": "Improved early childhood nutrition and early learning outcomes. Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span>; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\nchild education.\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors. The WBG portfolio, through the Health MDG PforR and\nAF, the ESPES AF, the Second Agriculture Growth Project, and the forthcoming Livestock and Fisheries Development Project, contributes to\nimproving supply- and demand-side investments in nutrition and health by providing household food security support, nutrition/health\nservices, and investing in diversified and nutrition-rich crops and livestock products. In water and <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span>, the focus is on providing clean\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions. The ESPES Program (through the forthcoming AF) will also help advance the Early Years\nagenda in PSNP woredas by supporting nutrition, early child development (ECD) and pre-primary education..
