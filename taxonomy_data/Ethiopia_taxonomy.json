In areas lacking shallow groundwater, development/expansion of low-cost, small-scale\\nirrigation solutions is desperately needed. Forest depletion is driven by fuelwood demand, unsustainable extraction, and agricultural\\nexpansion. Insecure land tenure and unplanned land use are factors in reduced investment in land <span id = \"word\">Resources</span>, which can exacerbate climate\\nand disaster risks and further aggravate water stress.\\nThe GoE is focused on building a \\x93climate-resilient green economy\\x94 to ensure environmental sustainability amid rapid economic growth; to\\nprotect and develop <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span> including land, soil, water, and trees (forests, woodlands, farms); and reduce climate risks, generate\\njobs and growth, and reduce emissions.\\nWhile recent investments in sustainable land and water <span id = \"word\">Management</span>, watershed restoration, land tenure, and roads have helped to reverse\\nthese trends, further investments are needed. WBG operations will continue to support increased resilience to drought and flooding,\\nimproved <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> resource and forest <span id = \"word\">Management</span>, and introduce technologies and policies that reduce climate and disaster risks and landbased\\ncarbon emissions..

In order for Ethiopia to create a more competitive private sector, a number of constraints must be removed, notably (as measured by its\\nranking among 190 economies in the 2017 Doing Business Report) starting a business (179th), getting credit (170th), trading across borders\\n(167th), and protecting minority investors (175th). Under GTP II, the GoE seeks to reduce regulatory barriers for businesses and investment,\\nsupport the quality of products and <span id = \"word\">Services</span> of firms to make them more competitive, supply land for business development through\\nindustrial parks, and pursue an exchange rate policy that promotes exports. The WBG, through the Competitiveness and Job Creation\\nProject, is helping to address the constraints to industrial zone development, investor promotion and industrial zone infrastructure. The\\nforthcoming National Quality Infrastructure Development Project will support improvements in Ethiopia\\x92s national infrastructure through\\ndelivery of quality assurance <span id = \"word\">Services</span> to enterprises. The World Bank and IFC are providing advisory <span id = \"word\">Services</span> to address business\\nenvironment issues through the Ethiopia Investment Climate Advisory Program. These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\\nsector growth while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation. Based on government demand the World Bank team will\\nsupport additional technical analysis during the CPF period. Limited access to credit for private investment is a binding constraint to the growth and competitiveness of firms, particularly Micro, Small\\nand Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -disproportionately for women-owned firms- and is a priority of GTP II. The WBG has launched a series\\nof interventions supporting the GoE\\x92s objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing Innovation for Financial\\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting Inclusive <span id = \"word\">Insurance</span> Project is supporting access to <span id = \"word\">Insurance</span> <span id = \"word\">Services</span> of quality, value and safety for\\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy.

Enhanced access to reliable electricity accelerates economic growth, improves quality of life and income opportunities for households, and\\nenhances competitiveness of the private sector, as noted in the SCD. As part of its GTP II, the GoE is focusing on (i) leveraging electricity\\nsector for economic growth by focusing on improved access; and (ii) continued electricity infrastructure development by tapping into\\nrenewable energy resources. The WBG is financing multiple operations to increase access to electricity services and improve reliability of\\nthe electricity network in Ethiopia. The Electricity Network Reinforcement and Expansion Project (ENREP) and its AF, and the forthcoming\\nEthiopia Electrification Program-Program for Results (ELEAP) (P160395), are financing electricity infrastructure development to expand and\\nimprove energy service delivery. ENREP and its AF also support (through a Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) credit facility to Micro\\n<span id = \"word\">Finance</span> Institutions (MFIs) and Private Sector Enterprises (PSEs)) the delivery of off-grid renewable energy solutions for households not\\nconnected to the grid. The WBG Lighting Africa Initiative has been providing advisory services to clients/companies in the off-grid lighting\\nsector to develop a private sector market for high-quality solar lanterns and kits that offer cleaner and safer off-grid lighting. The GoE intends\\nto diversify its reliance on hydropower by scaling up its solar, wind, and geothermal power generation capacity through public-private\\npartnerships (PPP) for power generation including private investments (independent power producers, IPPs). The WBG will provide IDA\\nguarantees for renewable energy IPPs, including solar projects under the 500-MW IFC Scaling Solar Initiative. IFC will also explore supporting\\nIPPs and MIGA will explore the use of guarantees for IPPs. Through an ESMAP grant, the WB also provides just in time analysis, data, and\\nsite-specific wind resource measurements for areas considered promising for IPP development. The IDA Geothermal Sector Development\\nProject is supporting geothermal resource development in Ethiopia..

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors. The WBG portfolio, through the Health MDG PforR and\\nAF, the ESPES AF, the Second Agriculture Growth Project, and the forthcoming Livestock and Fisheries Development Project, contributes to\\nimproving supply- and demand-side investments in nutrition and health by providing household food security support, nutrition/health\\nservices, and investing in diversified and nutrition-rich crops and livestock products. In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions. The ESPES Program (through the forthcoming AF) will also help advance the Early Years\\nagenda in PSNP woredas by supporting nutrition, early child development (ECD) and pre-primary education..

Enhanced access to reliable electricity accelerates economic growth, improves quality of life and income opportunities for households, and\\nenhances competitiveness of the private sector, as noted in the SCD. As part of its GTP II, the GoE is focusing on (i) leveraging electricity\\nsector for economic growth by focusing on improved access; and (ii) continued electricity infrastructure development by tapping into\\nrenewable energy resources. The WBG is financing multiple operations to increase access to electricity <span id = \"word\">Services</span> and improve reliability of\\nthe electricity network in Ethiopia. The Electricity Network Reinforcement and Expansion Project (ENREP) and its AF, and the forthcoming\\nEthiopia Electrification Program-Program for Results (ELEAP) (P160395), are financing electricity infrastructure development to expand and\\nimprove energy service delivery. ENREP and its AF also support (through a Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) credit facility to Micro\\nFinance Institutions (MFIs) and Private Sector Enterprises (PSEs)) the delivery of off-grid renewable energy solutions for households not\\nconnected to the grid. The WBG Lighting Africa Initiative has been providing advisory <span id = \"word\">Services</span> to clients/companies in the off-grid lighting\\nsector to develop a private sector market for high-quality solar lanterns and kits that offer cleaner and safer off-grid lighting. The GoE intends\\nto diversify its reliance on hydropower by scaling up its solar, wind, and geothermal power generation capacity through public-private\\npartnerships (PPP) for power generation including private investments (independent power producers, IPPs). The WBG will provide IDA\\nguarantees for renewable energy IPPs, including solar projects under the 500-MW IFC Scaling Solar Initiative. IFC will also explore supporting\\nIPPs and MIGA will explore the use of guarantees for IPPs. Through an ESMAP grant, the WB also provides just in time analysis, data, and\\nsite-specific wind resource measurements for areas considered promising for IPP development.

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health <span id = \"word\">Services</span>, water and sanitation; <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors. The WBG portfolio, through the Health MDG PforR and\\nAF, the ESPES AF, the Second Agriculture Growth Project, and the forthcoming Livestock and Fisheries Development Project, contributes to\\nimproving supply- and demand-side investments in nutrition and health by providing household food security support, nutrition/health\\n<span id = \"word\">Services</span>, and investing in diversified and nutrition-rich crops and livestock products. In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions. The ESPES Program (through the forthcoming AF) will also help advance the Early Years\\nagenda in PSNP woredas by supporting nutrition, early child development (ECD) and pre-primary education..

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, and recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty and protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need and require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, and informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor and vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly and disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long and costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; and (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women and youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, and more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal and lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\\ndestitution in urban areas.

In order for Ethiopia to create a more competitive private sector, a number of constraints must be removed, notably (as measured by its\\nranking among 190 economies in the 2017 Doing Business Report) starting a business (179th), getting credit (170th), trading across borders\\n(167th), and protecting minority investors (175th). Under GTP II, the GoE seeks to reduce regulatory barriers for businesses and investment,\\nsupport the quality of products and services of firms to make them more competitive, supply land for business development through\\nindustrial parks, and pursue an exchange rate policy that promotes exports. The WBG, through the Competitiveness and Job Creation\\nProject, is helping to address the constraints to industrial zone development, investor promotion and industrial zone infrastructure. The\\nforthcoming National Quality Infrastructure Development Project will support improvements in Ethiopia\\x92s national infrastructure through\\ndelivery of quality assurance services to enterprises. The World Bank and IFC are providing advisory services to address business\\nenvironment issues through the Ethiopia Investment Climate Advisory Program. These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\\nsector growth while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation. Based on government demand the World Bank team will\\nsupport additional technical analysis during the CPF period. Limited access to credit for private investment is a binding constraint to the growth and competitiveness of firms, particularly Micro, Small\\nand Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -disproportionately for women-owned firms- and is a priority of GTP II. The WBG has launched a series\\nof interventions supporting the GoE\\x92s objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing Innovation for Financial\\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting Inclusive Insurance Project is supporting access to insurance services of quality, value and safety for\\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\\nregime); and address SMEs\\x92 bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\\ncomplements the ongoing Women Entrepreneurship Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small enterprises.\\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

Agriculture is an important driver to boost inclusive growth, reduce poverty and narrow spatial disparities, particularly between rural and\\nurban areas; while meeting growing urban food demand and improving nutritional outcomes in rural and urban settings. Despite recent\\ngrowth in agricultural output, the sector is still characterized by low productivity as a result of low use of modern inputs, including improved\\nseed breeds, limited access to input and output markets and finance, and low availability of irrigation water and related climatic shocks.\\nAgro-processing and access to markets require improved connectivity and increased private investment in agro-processing and trade\\nlogistics.\\nAddressing gender productivity disparities is essential for inclusive rural development. Providing women farmers with better access to\\nagricultural services and infrastructure, and developing technologies that are gender sensitive will likely have direct pay-offs for nutritional\\noutcomes in agricultural production. Under GTP II, the GoE has articulated a policy on agricultural development-led industrialization, aimed\\nat increasing agricultural productivity, with efforts to expand this policy to agribusiness development and incentives for private investment.\\nThe WBG program of investments in productivity improvements is supporting improved public services for crop and livestock producers,\\nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and development of value chains and marketing services. Productivity gains among smallholder\\nlivestock producers will result in a reduction of GHG emissions per unit of product, thus contributing to achieving the communicated\\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC). IFC will continue building its portfolio in agriculture to improve access of livestock smallholder\\nproducers and processors to quality inputs which includes support to reforms on licenses and permit requirements for key livestock inputs.\\nMIGA will continue to explore expansion of its current portfolio in the agribusiness sector to support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct\\ninvestment into the sector in Ethiopia..

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, and recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty and protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need and require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, and informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor and vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly and disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long and costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; and (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women and youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, and more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal and lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security and Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty and vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; and (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities.

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II.

In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security <span id = \"word\">and</span> Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers <span id = \"word\">and</span> livelihood support, <span id = \"word\">and</span> indirectly through the public\\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households <span id = \"word\">and</span> access to livelihood opportunities..

The\\nforthcoming National Quality Infrastructure Development Project will support improvements in Ethiopia\\x92s national infrastructure through\\ndelivery of quality assurance services to enterprises. The World Bank and IFC are providing advisory services to address business\\nenvironment issues through the Ethiopia Investment Climate Advisory Program. These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\\nsector <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation. Based on government demand the World Bank team will\\nsupport additional technical analysis during the CPF period. Limited access to credit for private investment is a binding constraint to the <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> and competitiveness of firms, particularly Micro, Small\\nand Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -disproportionately for women-owned firms- and is a priority of GTP II. The WBG has launched a series\\nof interventions supporting the GoE\\x92s objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing Innovation for Financial\\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting <span id = \"word\">Inclusive</span> Insurance Project is supporting access to insurance services of quality, value and safety for\\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\\nregime); and address SMEs\\x92 bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\\ncomplements the ongoing Women Entrepreneurship Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small enterprises.\\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

Ethiopia needs new approaches to finance infrastructure through measures such as boosting tax revenues, increased private sector\\ninvolvement (including PPPs), greater selectivity and prioritization of investments, and improved public investment management. In the\\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya could\\nboost Ethiopia\\x92s annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis and policy advice. In the energy sector, the WB is supporting the development\\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a renewable energy guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions and preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, and\\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\\nborrowing; and a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2. As highlighted in GTP II, Ethiopia has decided to introduce PPP\\nfinancing for investments in infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),\\nand WBG are working together to support GoE in preparing a PPP Framework, establishing a PPP Unit, developing detailed implementation\\nprocedures, and identifying/developing future projects. This will help to develop Ethiopia\\x92s framework for PPPs and build the requisite\\ncapacity to boost private investment in infrastructure and other sectors.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, and a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture and thus vulnerable to climate shocks.

The GPT II includes plans to (i) improve labor productivity in the non-agricultural sector which is reliant on improved access to water at the\\nhousehold and enterprise level; and (ii) manage the urbanization process so as to avoid the potential stresses on existing water and\\nsanitation services that could result in negative impact on the environment and public health. Despite a major decrease in the proportion\\nof people openly defecating (from 92 percent in 1990 to 29 percent in 2015), 43 percent of those with access to toilets in 2015 used either\\nan unimproved or shared facility. Addis Ababa is the only Ethiopian city that has some sewer system, covering only 10 percent of the\\nresidents. Unsafe water in rural areas poses risks to good health and nutrition, and improved access to water services will especially benefit\\nwomen who typically bear the burden of fetching water. GoE programs are focused on providing access to safe and sustainable water supply\\nand improved sanitation. WBG operations will support improvements in water and sanitation and contribute to the Government\\x92s goal of\\nattaining 100 percent national potable water supply coverage and improving sanitation access during GTP II..

Despite strong economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors. The WBG portfolio, through the Health MDG PforR and\\nAF, the ESPES AF, the Second Agriculture <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> Project, and the forthcoming Livestock and Fisheries Development Project, contributes to\\nimproving supply- and demand-side investments in nutrition and health by providing household food security support, nutrition/health\\nservices, and investing in diversified and nutrition-rich crops and livestock products. In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions. The ESPES Program (through the forthcoming AF) will also help advance the Early Years\\nagenda in PSNP woredas by supporting nutrition, early child development (ECD) and pre-primary education..

High rates of forest depletion and land degradation in Ethiopia aggravate water stress, limit economic performance, and undermine\\nresilience at the national and household levels. In Ethiopia less than 1 percent of land cultivated by smallholders, who produce over 95\\npercent of total agricultural production, is irrigated. In areas lacking shallow groundwater, development/expansion of low-cost, small-scale\\nirrigation solutions is desperately needed. Forest depletion is driven by fuelwood demand, unsustainable extraction, and agricultural\\nexpansion.

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human <span id = \"word\">Development</span> indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human <span id = \"word\">Development</span> Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as drought; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II.

In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions.

Ethiopia needs new approaches to finance infrastructure through measures such as boosting tax revenues, increased private sector\\ninvolvement (including PPPs), greater selectivity and prioritization of investments, and improved public investment management. In the\\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya could\\nboost Ethiopia\\x92s annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis and policy advice. In the <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> sector, the WB is supporting the development\\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a <span id = \"word\">Renewable</span> <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions and preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, and\\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\\nborrowing; and a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2. As highlighted in GTP II, Ethiopia has decided to introduce PPP\\nfinancing for investments in infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),\\nand WBG are working together to support GoE in preparing a PPP Framework, establishing a PPP Unit, developing detailed implementation\\nprocedures, and identifying/developing future projects. This will help to develop Ethiopia\\x92s framework for PPPs and build the requisite\\ncapacity to boost private investment in infrastructure and other sectors. The WBG will work with GoE to leverage private financial resources\\nto help close the infrastructure gap, and IFC will explore PPPs in infrastructure.

High rates of forest depletion and land degradation in Ethiopia aggravate water stress, limit economic performance, and undermine\\nresilience at the national and household levels. In Ethiopia less than 1 percent of land cultivated by smallholders, who produce over 95\\npercent of total agricultural production, is irrigated.

In the\\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Kenya could\\nboost Ethiopia\\x92s annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis <span id = \"word\">and</span> policy advice. In the energy sector, the WB is supporting the development\\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a renewable energy guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions <span id = \"word\">and</span> preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\\nborrowing; <span id = \"word\">and</span> a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security <span id = \"word\">and</span> Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers <span id = \"word\">and</span> livelihood support, <span id = \"word\">and</span> indirectly through the public\\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in rural <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span>. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households <span id = \"word\">and</span> access to livelihood opportunities..

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security <span id = \"word\">and</span> Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers <span id = \"word\">and</span> livelihood support, <span id = \"word\">and</span> indirectly through the public\\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households <span id = \"word\">and</span> access to livelihood opportunities..

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas.

The World Bank and IFC are providing advisory services to address business\\nenvironment issues through the Ethiopia Investment Climate Advisory Program. These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\\nsector growth while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation.

Agriculture is an important driver to boost inclusive growth, reduce poverty and narrow spatial disparities, particularly between rural and\\nurban areas; while meeting growing urban food demand and improving nutritional outcomes in rural and urban settings. Despite recent\\ngrowth in agricultural output, the sector is still characterized by low productivity as a result of low use of modern inputs, including improved\\nseed breeds, limited access to input and output markets and finance, and low availability of irrigation water and related climatic shocks.\\nAgro-processing and access to markets require improved connectivity and increased private investment in agro-processing and trade\\nlogistics.\\nAddressing gender productivity disparities is essential for inclusive rural development. Providing women farmers with better access to\\nagricultural services and infrastructure, and developing technologies that are gender sensitive will likely have direct pay-offs for nutritional\\noutcomes in agricultural production. Under GTP II, the GoE has articulated a <span id = \"word\">Policy</span> on agricultural development-led industrialization, aimed\\nat increasing agricultural productivity, with efforts to expand this <span id = \"word\">Policy</span> to agribusiness development and incentives for private investment.\\nThe WBG program of investments in productivity improvements is supporting improved public services for crop and livestock producers,\\nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and development of value chains and marketing services.

More spatially equitable growth requires (i) improved connectivity between production centers and markets, both domestic and export;\\nand (ii) enhanced regional growth centers and secondary cities where industrial production and service provision take place. GTP II is\\naddressing connectivity constraints to competitiveness by supporting improved transport infrastructure and services and trade logistics. The\\nWBG, through projects that support the Government\\x92s Road Sector Development Program, is helping to strengthen transport connectivity\\nand reduce travel times for businesses between productive areas and markets and processing facilities. The Expressway Development\\nSupport Project is strengthening government\\x92s capacity to construct and operate strategic road logistics corridors. The forthcoming Trade\\nLogistics Project will support infrastructure improvements; capacity building; and <span id = \"word\">Policy</span>, regulatory, and administrative reforms to enhance\\nthe performance of the Ethiopia-Djibouti corridor. IFC will continue providing advisory services to reduce export and import barriers, reforms\\nwhich are expected to yield savings to the private sector. Given the expected urbanization rate of about 5.4 percent a year in the coming decade, urban population growth represents a huge\\nopportunity to shift the structure and location of economic activity from rural agriculture to the larger and more diversified urban industrial\\nand service sectors. Well-managed urbanization to enhance regional growth centers and secondary cities could help to catalyze growth, job\\ncreation, and prosperity for a growing number of Ethiopians.

Under GTP II, the GoE has articulated a policy on agricultural development-led industrialization, aimed\\nat increasing agricultural productivity, with efforts to expand this policy to agribusiness development and incentives for private investment.\\nThe WBG program of investments in productivity improvements is supporting improved public services for crop and livestock producers,\\nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and development of value chains and marketing services. Productivity gains among smallholder\\nlivestock producers will result in a reduction of GHG emissions per unit of product, thus contributing to achieving the communicated\\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC). IFC will continue building its portfolio in agriculture to improve access of livestock smallholder\\nproducers and processors to quality inputs which includes support to reforms on licenses and permit requirements for key livestock inputs.\\nMIGA will continue to explore expansion of its current portfolio in the agribusiness sector to support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct\\ninvestment into the sector in Ethiopia..

This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions <span id = \"word\">and</span> preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\\nborrowing; <span id = \"word\">and</span> a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2. As highlighted in GTP II, Ethiopia has decided to introduce PPP\\nfinancing for investments in infrastructure. The African Development Bank (AfDB), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> WBG are working together to support GoE in preparing a PPP Framework, establishing a PPP Unit, developing detailed implementation\\nprocedures, <span id = \"word\">and</span> identifying/developing future projects. This will help to develop Ethiopia\\x92s framework for PPPs <span id = \"word\">and</span> build the requisite\\ncapacity to boost private investment in infrastructure <span id = \"word\">and</span> other sectors. The WBG will work with GoE to leverage private financial resources\\nto help close the infrastructure gap, <span id = \"word\">and</span> IFC will explore PPPs in infrastructure.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security <span id = \"word\">and</span> Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers <span id = \"word\">and</span> livelihood support, <span id = \"word\">and</span> indirectly through the public\\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-<span id = \"word\">Finance</span>d operation helps\\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households <span id = \"word\">and</span> access to livelihood opportunities..

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas.

Two types of vulnerabilities define opportunities for improving safety nets in Ethiopia. First, despite a significant decline in poverty rates\\nover the past decade, a large number of Ethiopians live in chronic poverty, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a significant percentage of the rural poor are dependent on\\nrain-fed agriculture <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus vulnerable to climate shocks. The Government has put in place a safety net in the most food-insecure areas,\\nwhich can be scaled-up in response to shocks such as drought, <span id = \"word\">and</span> recently launched a safety net program for urban areas. While evidence\\nshows that the Government\\x92s safety net programs reduce poverty <span id = \"word\">and</span> protect people from shocks, these two safety net programs do not\\nreach all in need <span id = \"word\">and</span> require sustained public financing. Second, the scope of formal social protection is limited, <span id = \"word\">and</span> informal safety nets\\nare weak in urban areas. Urban poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable are prone to (i) higher rates of poverty among urban elderly <span id = \"word\">and</span> disabled; (ii) high levels\\nof urban food insecurity; (iii) long <span id = \"word\">and</span> costly job-search processes in urban labor markets; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (iv) high rates of urban unemployment,\\nespecially for women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth. Women in urban areas are less likely to engage in the labor market, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more likely to work in less skilled,\\ninformal <span id = \"word\">and</span> lower-paying jobs. Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide social protection system for poor <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable groups to increase social protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s <span id = \"word\">and</span> pastoral lowl<span id = \"word\">and</span>s, <span id = \"word\">and</span> unemployment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ndestitution in urban areas.

Agriculture is an important driver to boost inclusive growth, reduce poverty and narrow spatial disparities, particularly between rural and\nurban areas; while meeting growing urban food demand and improving nutritional outcomes in rural and urban settings.

Greater scope is needed for citizens to hold government\\nentities accountable. Efforts have also been made to engage citizens in decision making at lower levels of government, such as the district\\nlevel. Citizens\\x92 voices must be amplified and engaged, in line with GTP II commitment to strengthen the democratization process.

Female labor force participation rates in urban Ethiopia are 13 percentage points lower than for males, and\\nfemale youth unemployment is particularly high (25 percent versus 15 percent for young men).\\nThe GoE is building a harmonized, nationwide <span id = \"word\">Social</span> protection system for poor and vulnerable groups to increase <span id = \"word\">Social</span> protection coverage.\\nThe existing system is extended to address vulnerability in the drought-prone highlands and pastoral lowlands, and unemployment and\\ndestitution in urban areas. Within the framework of GTP II, the GoE has developed the Urban Food Security and Job Creation Strategy to\\nreduce poverty and vulnerability among 4.7 million urban dwellers living below the poverty line.\\nWBG operations support (i) establishing urban safety nets; (ii) improving the effectiveness of the Government\\x92s safety net in rural areas,\\nincluding responsiveness to drought induced food insecurity; and (iii) supporting women-owned SMEs in targeted cities. Project\\ninterventions in rural areas help to address rural poverty directly through transfers and livelihood support, and indirectly through the public\\nworks that aim to transform the natural environment and invest in rural infrastructure. In urban areas, the WBG-financed operation helps\\nestablish urban safety net mechanisms to improve incomes of poor urban households and access to livelihood opportunities..

Ethiopia has instituted reforms to reduce corruption among civil servants, which is particularly important as service delivery is decentralized.\\nAccording to Transparency International\\x92s annual Perceptions of Corruption Index, Ethiopia was ranked 103rd out of 175 countries in 2015\\n(an improvement over 2007, when Ethiopia was ranked 138th out of 175 countries). Greater scope is needed for citizens to hold government\\nentities accountable. Efforts have also been made to engage citizens in decision making at lower levels of government, such as the district\\nlevel. Citizens\\x92 voices must be amplified and engaged, in line with GTP II commitment to strengthen the democratization process. Improved\\ndata collection at all levels of government, by enhancing the capacity of the Central Statistical Agency, will enable monitoring of progress\\nagainst development milestones, dissemination of results, empowering citizen groups in the <span id = \"word\">Social</span> accountability process, and informing\\nevidence-based policy-making.\\nGovernment systems, such as procurement, internal audit, accounting and reporting systems, environmental, <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and financial oversight\\nrequire further strengthening. GTP II includes plans to implement capacity-building programs in support of development and good\\ngovernance goals. The WBG is supporting enhanced fraud- and corruption-prevention structures at the woreda level by placing Ethics and\\nAnti-Corruption Officers in all basic sector offices, as well as working to strengthen the PFM system at all levels to enhance governance and\\nservice delivery. GTP II includes plans to modernize the country procurement system by implementing an e-procurement system under its\\ngood governance theme. The World Bank is supporting implementation of the e-procurement system through the PFM project..

In order for Ethiopia to create a more competitive private sector, a number of constraints must be removed, notably (as measured by its\\nranking among 190 economies in the 2017 Doing Business Report) starting a business (179th), getting credit (170th), trading across borders\\n(167th), and protecting minority investors (175th). Under GTP II, the GoE seeks to reduce regulatory barriers for businesses and investment,\\nsupport the quality of products and services of firms to make them more competitive, supply land for business development through\\nindustrial parks, and pursue an exchange rate policy that promotes exports. The WBG, through the Competitiveness and Job Creation\\nProject, is helping to address the constraints to industrial zone development, investor promotion and industrial zone infrastructure. The\\nforthcoming National Quality Infrastructure Development Project will support improvements in Ethiopia\\x92s national infrastructure through\\ndelivery of quality assurance services to <span id = \"word\">Enterprises</span>. The World Bank and IFC are providing advisory services to address business\\nenvironment issues through the Ethiopia Investment Climate Advisory Program. These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\\nsector growth while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation.

The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\\nregime); and address SMEs\\x92 bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\\ncomplements the ongoing Women Entrepreneurship Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small <span id = \"word\">Enterprises</span>.\\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

Enhanced access to reliable electricity accelerates economic growth, improves quality of life and income opportunities for <span id = \"word\">Household</span>s, and\\nenhances competitiveness of the private sector, as noted in the SCD. As part of its GTP II, the GoE is focusing on (i) leveraging electricity\\nsector for economic growth by focusing on improved access; and (ii) continued electricity infrastructure development by tapping into\\nrenewable energy resources. The WBG is financing multiple operations to increase access to electricity services and improve reliability of\\nthe electricity network in Ethiopia. The Electricity Network Reinforcement and Expansion Project (ENREP) and its AF, and the forthcoming\\nEthiopia Electrification Program-Program for Results (ELEAP) (P160395), are financing electricity infrastructure development to expand and\\nimprove energy service delivery. ENREP and its AF also support (through a Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) credit facility to Micro\\nFinance Institutions (MFIs) and Private Sector <span id = \"word\">Enterprises</span> (PSEs)) the delivery of off-grid renewable energy solutions for <span id = \"word\">Household</span>s not\\nconnected to the grid. The WBG Lighting Africa Initiative has been providing advisory services to clients/companies in the off-grid lighting\\nsector to develop a private sector market for high-quality solar lanterns and kits that offer cleaner and safer off-grid lighting. The GoE intends\\nto diversify its reliance on hydropower by scaling up its solar, wind, and geothermal power generation capacity through public-private\\npartnerships (PPP) for power generation including private investments (independent power producers, IPPs). The WBG will provide IDA\\nguarantees for renewable energy IPPs, including solar projects under the 500-MW IFC Scaling Solar Initiative. IFC will also explore supporting\\nIPPs and MIGA will explore the use of guarantees for IPPs. Through an ESMAP grant, the WB also provides just in time analysis, data, and\\nsite-specific wind resource measurements for areas considered promising for IPP development.

These joint efforts will help reduce legal and administrative\nbarriers to foreign investment, strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for foreign investor protection and transparency, and help\nattract additional FDI in key sectors (food & beverages, tourism, and leather/garments). IFC will also pursue investments to support private\nsector growth while also achieving demonstration effects and MIGA will actively seek to expand use of guarantees to provide reassurance\nto foreign investors and thereby support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. The World Bank provided recent\nanalysis on the importance of the exchange rate for structural transformation. Based on government demand the World Bank team will\nsupport additional technical analysis during the CPF period. Limited access to credit for private investment is a binding constraint to the growth and competitiveness of firms, particularly Micro, Small\nand Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) -disproportionately for women-owned firms- and is a priority of GTP II. The WBG has launched a series\nof interventions supporting the GoEs objective of enhancing access to finance, especially for MSMEs. The Harnessing Innovation for Financial\nInclusion (HiFi) Project is leveraging rural and urban safety net programs in Ethiopia to expand access to transaction accounts by the\nunbanked. The FIRST-funded Promoting Inclusive Insurance Project is supporting access to insurance services of quality, value and safety for\nlow income groups and contribute to broader financial inclusion. The Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF) is helping Ethiopia to\nimplement the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The SME Finance Project is helping to support financial intermediaries to deploy novel\nlending techniques to reach SMEs; build the necessary financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral registry, insolvency and creditor/debtor\nregime); and address SMEs bankability constraints by providing technical assistance, especially on business development. This intervention\ncomplements the ongoing Women <span id = \"word\">Entrepreneurship</span> Development Project that is serving female-owned micro and small enterprises.\nAdvisory services will continue to strengthen the secured transactions and collateral registry regime and to enhance the Ethiopian credit\ninformation system in compliance with international best practice.

Ethiopia needs new approaches to finance infrastructure through measures such as boosting tax revenues, increased private sector\ninvolvement (including PPPs), greater selectivity and prioritization of investments, and improved public investment management. In the\npower sector, in addition to generating sufficient power for domestic consumption, per GTP II objectives, the GoE is developing generation\ncapacity for export as a means to increase power sector revenues. It is estimated that electricity exports to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya could\nboost Ethiopias annual export revenue potential to as much as US$500 million by the end of the decade. To support this objective, the WBG\nis financing the Eastern Electricity Highway Project under the First Phase of the Eastern Africa Power Integration Program. The WBG is also\nsupporting a series of ASA to provide client-driven analysis and policy advice. In the energy sector, the WB is supporting the development\nof IPPs though technical assistance as well as preparation of a renewable energy guarantee for Independent Power Producers (see 1.2.\nabove). This policy dialogue is anchored by the annual discussions and preparation of the Ethiopia Economic Update Series, and\ncomplemented by policy advice on issues such as annual DSAs, which are produced jointly with the IMF, to monitor non-concessional\nborrowing; and a tax study as part of the follow up to the PER Phase 2.

Despite strong economic growth and substantial progress on human development indicators over the past decade, poverty remains high in\\nEthiopia and the country ranks poorly on the UNDP Human Development Index. One reason for these persistent gaps is that millions of\\nyoung children are not reaching their full potential due to inadequate nutrition, a lack of early stimulation and learning, and exposure to\\nstress. These factors adversely affect physical, cognitive and socio-emotional capacity to learn, earn, and compete later in life. Among these\\ngaps, childhood stunting (with 38 percent of under-5 children stunted), and poor early learning, persist in Ethiopia. The bottlenecks include\\nhigh micronutrient deficiencies in children and pregnant/lactating women; malnutrition among women; high disease burdens especially\\ninfections, diarrhea and malaria; insufficient access to health services, water and sanitation; climate risks such as <span id = \"word\">Drought</span>; and a lack of early\\nchild education.\\nEthiopia is committed to the Early Years agenda to end child undernutrition by 2030 as stated in its Seqota Declaration and GPT II. GoE is\\nimplementing the second donor-supported National Nutrition Program (NNP2). Ethiopia faces challenges in financing, implementing, and\\ncoordinating the multi-sectoral programs, both within Government and with donors. The WBG portfolio, through the Health MDG PforR and\\nAF, the ESPES AF, the Second Agriculture Growth Project, and the forthcoming Livestock and Fisheries Development Project, contributes to\\nimproving supply- and demand-side investments in nutrition and health by providing household food security support, nutrition/health\\nservices, and investing in diversified and nutrition-rich crops and livestock products. In water and sanitation, the focus is on providing clean\\nwater and reducing open defecation that increases the disease risks and lowers child nutrition outcomes. In education, WBG operations\\ncontribute to parental engagement for early stimulation and school readiness programs, which remains a priority focus for the Education\\nportfolio and will be used in future interventions. The ESPES Program (through the forthcoming AF) will also help advance the Early Years\\nagenda in PSNP woredas by supporting nutrition, early child development (ECD) and pre-primary education..

Under GTP II, the GoE has articulated a policy on agricultural development-led industrialization, aimed\\nat increasing agricultural productivity, with efforts to expand this policy to agribusiness development and incentives for private investment.\\nThe WBG program of investments in productivity improvements is supporting improved public services for crop and livestock producers,\\nirrigation and drainage infrastructure, and development of value chains and marketing services. Productivity gains among smallholder\\nlivestock producers will result in a reduction of GHG emissions per unit of product, thus contributing to achieving the communicated\\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC). IFC will continue building its portfolio in agriculture to improve access of livestock smallholder\\nproducers and processors to quality inputs which includes support to reforms on licenses and permit requirements for key livestock inputs.\\nMIGA will continue to explore expansion of its current portfolio in the agribusiness sector to support GoE efforts to attract foreign direct\\ninvestment into the sector in Ethiopia..
