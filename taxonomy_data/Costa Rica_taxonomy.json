Currently, Costa Ricaü¾Œ£¤¼s <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> <span id = \"word\">Supply</span> is not able to furnish the skills needed for a <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> market supporting a high value-added economy. The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher education, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, and lack of accountability of providers. Access to public universities is contingent upon successfully passing an entrance examination and is limited by quotas due to limitations in physical infrastructure and human resources, most impacting the poor. The quality of institutions and programs (especially among the numerous private universities) is uneven due to lack of accredited programs and low quality of university faculty. Furthermore, few university programs and curricula are relevant for <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, and computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality and relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs and research to ongoing work of industry leaders, and invest in the professional development of university professors. In addition, by identifying (and subsequently responding to) drivers of secondary drop-outs, the Government hopes to not only increase secondary completion, but also increase access to, and improve the quality of tertiary education, so as to bring educational outcomes closer to the standards of OECD member states.

Currently, Costa Ricaü¾Œ£¤¼s labor supply is not able to furnish the <span id = \"word\">Skills</span> needed for a labor market supporting a high value-added economy. The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher <span id = \"word\">Education</span>, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of accountability of providers.

The quality of institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> programs (especially among the numerous private universities) is uneven due to lack of accredited programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> low quality of university faculty. Furthermore, few university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, <span id = \"word\">and</span> computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> research to ongoing work of industry leaders, <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in the professional development of university professors.

To continue to deliver high-quality health services to all Costa Ricans in an efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustainable manner, the countryü¾Œ£¤¼s public universal health insurance requires strengthening. This requires a three-pronged approach. First, the organization of health services requires adaptation to better tackle new demographic <span id = \"word\">and</span> epidemiological challenges to ensure quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> timeliness of service delivery. These shifts present challenges to the financial sustainability of the current health care model, given the high costs associated with a narrow approach on individual <span id = \"word\">and</span> curative technologies. The international experience of OECD countries suggests that there are two key areas of intervention needed to ensure quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustainability of universal health coverage: (i) the reorganization of health care services within the framework of integrated health care networks of providers that improve timeliness <span id = \"word\">and</span> continuity of care; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (ii) the strengthening of institutional financial <span id = \"word\">and</span> administrative capacity to foster suitable incentives to reduce the burden of disease of non-communicable conditions while boosting efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> using out-of-pocket expenditures with transparency <span id = \"word\">and</span> clear lines of accountability. Finally, to support these two objectives, the health sectorü¾Œ£¤¼s financial model of budget <span id = \"word\">and</span> resource allocation should be revisited. The CCSS is developing a new strategic vision for the universal health insurance system, seeking to improve the healthy years of life by improving the institutional capacity to prevent, diagnose, <span id = \"word\">and</span> treat non-communicable conditions, strengthening the continuity of care, setting up quality control mechanisms, streamlining central management, <span id = \"word\">and</span> improving budgetary <span id = \"word\">and</span> resource allocation practices. The expected outcome of this objective is that the efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> quality of the health insurance system improves, leading over time to better results for the population. Given that the dialogue on the <span id = \"word\">Social</span> <span id = \"word\">Protection</span> systems is still in early stages, an indicator on <span id = \"word\">Social</span> <span id = \"word\">Protection</span> has not yet been defined.. 5.1 Increased quality of services, as measured by decreased patient hospital readmissions (disaggregated by gender) Baseline: TBD  (2015) Target:    TBD  (2019) \n5.2 Increased efficiency, as measured by reduced unnecessary hospitalizations for surgical procedures eligible to be performed in an outpatient setting (disaggregated by gender) Baseline: TBD  (2015) Target:    TBD  (2019)"

The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher education, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, and lack of accountability of providers. Access to public universities is contingent upon successfully passing an entrance examination and is limited by quotas due to limitations in physical infrastructure and human resources, most impacting the poor. The quality of institutions and programs (especially among the numerous private universities) is uneven due to lack of accredited programs and low quality of university faculty. Furthermore, few university programs and curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, and computing.

Furthermore, few university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, <span id = \"word\">and</span> computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> research to ongoing work of industry leaders, <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in the professional development of university professors.

The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher education, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of accountability of providers. Access to public universities is contingent upon successfully passing an entrance examination <span id = \"word\">and</span> is limited by quotas due to limitations in physical <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> human resources, most impacting the poor. The quality of institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> programs (especially among the numerous private universities) is uneven due to lack of accredited programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> low quality of university faculty. Furthermore, few university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, <span id = \"word\">and</span> computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> research to ongoing work of industry leaders, <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in the professional development of university professors. In addition, by identifying (<span id = \"word\">and</span> subsequently responding to) drivers of secondary drop-outs, the Government hopes to not only increase secondary completion, but also increase access to, <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve the quality of tertiary education, so as to bring educational outcomes closer to the st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards of OECD member states. The expected outcome of this objective is improved access, quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> relevance of higher education in Costa Rica.   \\n . 1.1  Increased number of students enrolled in priority areas in four public universities Baseline: 49,638 (undergraduate) +                    4,265 (graduate)  (2014)                  24,684 (female, undergrad) (2015)                    2,004 (female, grad) (2015)                     Target:    57,492 (undergraduate) +                    4,600 (graduate)                    29,250 (female, undergrad) (2019)                    2,162 (female, grad) (2019)\\n\\n1.2 Increased number of officially accredited programs at four public universities Baseline:   68 (2015)  Target:      85 (2019)\", \n\"Increase access to finance to generate productive opportunities.

Costa Rica is renowned for its ability to simultaneously pursue economic <span id = \"word\">and</span> social improvements while reaping local <span id = \"word\">and</span> global environmental benefits. It has managed to position itself as a leader in environmental conservation efforts, reversing deforestation trends over the past decades based on the successful Payment for Environmental Services system, <span id = \"word\">and</span> enabling it to focus its strong image as a green travel destination. Costa Rica has also made significant progress on the climate mitigation agenda <span id = \"word\">and</span> reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an early adopter of the REDD+ <span id = \"word\">and</span> the first country to put REDD+ onto the agenda of international climate negotiations. Yet, Costa Rica is at significant risk for disasters, some of which are likely to increase in frequency as a result of climate change. The country is prone to a number of disasters, including geophysical hazards <span id = \"word\">and</span> occurrence of extreme weather events. Should such extreme disasters occur, the country currently lacks access to substantial contingent funds to address the needs of the population, which could increase macroeconomic instability. <span id = \"word\">and</span> the ability for Costa Rica to sustain its current model of conservation <span id = \"word\">and</span> reforestation is limited both financially <span id = \"word\">and</span> physically, requiring an approach that is better adapted to the broader productive l<span id = \"word\">and</span>scape. With nearly 30 percent of the population living in rural settings <span id = \"word\">and</span> deriving much of its income from rural sources, there are increasing tensions between providing for income <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, while both preserving the achievements of increasing or sustaining the forest cover <span id = \"word\">and</span> enhancing the resilience of the community to increasing climate change <span id = \"word\">and</span> extreme events.

Currently, Costa Rica\\x92s labor supply is not able to furnish the skills needed for a labor market supporting a high value-added economy. The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher education, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of accountability of providers. Access to public universities is contingent upon successfully passing an entrance examination <span id = \"word\">and</span> is limited by quotas due to limitations in physical infrastructure <span id = \"word\">and</span> human resources, most impacting the poor.

Furthermore, few university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, <span id = \"word\">and</span> computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality <span id = \"word\">and</span> relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs <span id = \"word\">and</span> research to ongoing work of industry leaders, <span id = \"word\">and</span> invest in the professional development of university professors.

Boosting inclusion and growth in the labor market requires confronting the dual challenge of maintaining competitiveness of high valueadded sectors, while improving the viability of low value-added sectors.

A critical priority identified by the SCD is that of infrastructure, including quality of transport infrastructure and rising electricity costs. Further, the Government has faced significant challenges in executing infrastructure investment in a timely manner. The deficiencies in productive infrastructure raise concerns about the level of investment needed and the long-term competitiveness of the country. This infrastructure deficit reduces the potential of local firms to grow and create jobs, in particular for firms that operate outside <span id = \"word\">Free</span> Trade <span id = \"word\">Zones</span>. Infrastructure improvement poses a number of tradeoffs, including the need to intervene in protected areas (in the case of clean energy production), as well as the need to control the current fiscal deficit.  Given the necessity of continuing to invest in infrastructure, and the reality of fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must look for options for private sector participation in the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure. The expected outcome of these investments under this objective include increased power generation from renewable resources..  3.1 People provided with new or improved access to electricity  Baseline:             0 (2015) Target:     348,000 (2019)"

"para": "Enhance higher education to improve skills. The competitiveness of Costa Rica hinges on the existence of a skilled labor force to support its trajectory towards a high value-added economy and reduce the skills-income gap. Currently, Costa Ricaü¾Œ£¤¼s labor supply is not able to furnish the skills needed for a labor market supporting a high value-added economy. The country faces a number of bottlenecks in higher education, including limited access, poor quality, lack of relevance of programs, and lack of accountability of providers. Access to public universities is contingent upon successfully passing an entrance examination and is limited by quotas due to limitations in physical infrastructure and <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span>, most impacting the poor. The quality of institutions and programs (especially among the numerous private universities) is uneven due to lack of accredited programs and low quality of university faculty. Furthermore, few university programs and curricula are relevant for labor market needs, with only 16.7 percent of university programs focusing on basic sciences, engineering, and computing. Finally, universities are granted full autonomy but will little accountability for results, despite high levels of expenditures. In response to the gaps in quality and relevance of university programs, the Government seeks to promote the study of subjects relevant to the national economy, increase accreditation of university programs, introduce linkages of university programs and research to ongoing work of industry leaders, and invest in the professional development of university professors. In addition, by identifying (and subsequently responding to) drivers of secondary drop-outs, the Government hopes to not only increase secondary completion, but also increase access to, and improve the quality of tertiary education, so as to bring educational outcomes closer to the standards of OECD member states. The expected outcome of this objective is improved access, quality and relevance of higher education in Costa Rica.   \n . 1.1  Increased number of students enrolled in priority areas in four public universities Baseline: 49,638 (undergraduate) +                    4,265 (graduate)  (2014)                  24,684 (female, undergrad) (2015)                    2,004 (female, grad) (2015)                     Target:    57,492 (undergraduate) +                    4,600 (graduate)                    29,250 (female, undergrad) (2019)                    2,162 (female, grad) (2019)\n\n1.2 Increased number of officially accredited programs at four public universities Baseline:   68 (2015)  Target:      85 (2019)"

Sustainability of Costa Rica\\x92s strong Social Compact requires addressing tensions between high levels of social spending and the country\\x92s ability to deliver high-quality, efficient services and improve results and outcomes. To continue to deliver high-quality health services to all Costa Ricans in an efficient and sustainable manner, the country\\x92s public universal health insurance requires strengthening. This requires a three-pronged approach. First, the organization of health services requires adaptation to better tackle new demographic and epidemiological challenges to ensure quality and timeliness of service delivery. These shifts present challenges to the financial sustainability of the current health care model, given the high costs associated with a narrow approach on individual and curative technologies. The international experience of OECD countries suggests that there are two key areas of intervention needed to ensure quality and sustainability of universal health coverage: (i) the reorganization of health care services within the framework of integrated health care networks of providers that improve timeliness and continuity of care; and (ii) the strengthening of institutional financial and administrative capacity to foster suitable incentives to reduce the burden of disease of non-communicable conditions while boosting efficiency and using out-of-pocket expenditures with transparency and clear lines of accountability. Finally, to support these two objectives, the health sector\\x92s financial model of budget and resource allocation should be revisited. The CCSS is developing a new strategic vision for the universal health insurance system, seeking to improve the healthy years of life by improving the institutional capacity to prevent, diagnose, and treat non-communicable conditions, strengthening the continuity of care, setting up quality control mechanisms, streamlining central management, and improving budgetary and resource allocation practices. The expected outcome of this objective is that the efficiency and quality of the health insurance system improves, leading over time to better results for the population. Given that the dialogue on the social protection systems is still in early stages, an indicator on social protection has not yet been defined.. 5.1 Increased quality of services, as measured by decreased patient hospital readmissions (disaggregated by gender) Baseline: TBD  (2015) Target:    TBD  (2019) \\n5.2 Increased efficiency, as measured by reduced unnecessary hospitalizations for surgical procedures eligible to be performed in an outpatient setting (disaggregated by gender) Baseline: TBD  (2015) Target:    TBD  (2019)\"\n)"

Moreover, reducing the infrastructure deficit would increase competitiveness, growth, and environmental sustainability. A critical priority identified by the SCD is that of infrastructure, including quality of transport infrastructure and rising electricity costs. Further, the Government has faced significant challenges in executing infrastructure investment in a timely manner. The deficiencies in productive infrastructure raise concerns about the level of investment needed and the long-term competitiveness of the country. This infrastructure deficit reduces the potential of local firms to grow and create jobs, in particular for firms that operate outside Free Trade Zones. Infrastructure improvement poses a number of tradeoffs, including the need to intervene in protected areas (in the case of clean energy production), as well as the need to control the current fiscal deficit.  Given the necessity of continuing to invest in infrastructure, and the reality of fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must look for options for private sector participation in the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure.
