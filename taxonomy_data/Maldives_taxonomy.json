Addressing these challenges is therefore a priority for the government.

"para": "Enhancing employability and economic opportunities for Maldivians . The limited ability of the population to seize economic opportunities, particularly in the fast-growing tourism industry, is due to a host of factors, including: (1) reservation wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs; (3) social norms; (4) lack of adequate transport, (5) and lack of access to finance. Furthermore, progressively more conservative views in the Maldives have had an impact on female labor participation. The lack of growth in fisheries is also an important factor behind the limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction, especially in the atolls, as fisheries represent a significant source of jobs and livelihoods for the Maldivian population. In line with the governments priorities, WBG activities will seek to contribute to enhancing employability and economic opportunities for Maldivians in the productive sectors, building on improved management of the sectors, enhanced access to financial services, and quality education. The proposed interventions in the productive sectors, particularly tourism and fisheries, will aim to contribute to address some of the constraints associated with the demand for skilled labor.

For enhanced inclusiveness and sustainability, the interventions aim to set the stage for better integration of climatic risks and resilience objectives into development planning at the island level. The strategy will also emphasize community participation in the assessment, monitoring and stewardship of key resources such as fisheries and coral reefs. Furthermore the strategy will seek to address shortcomings in the management of sewage and solid waste management that pose a threat to fresh water sources and marine life.
