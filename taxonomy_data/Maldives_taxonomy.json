Shortcomings in climate adaptive planning and the management of natural resources in the Maldives, particularly fishery resources, coral reefs, waste management and fresh water, together with the country\\x92s high dependency on imported fuel as a source of energy, represent key pressing issues which may affect the jobs, livelihoods and <span id = \"word\">Health</span> of the poorer and bottom 40 percent of the population disproportionately. Addressing these challenges is therefore a priority for the government. The government also seeks to reduce dependency on imported fuel, so as to increase the country\\x92s competitiveness, generate new jobs opportunities, and free up fiscal resources for poverty-reducing and equity-enhancing expenditures. In line with this, the WBG strategy will therefore seek to contribute to improving climate adaptive planning and natural resource management, and to support electricity generation from renewable sources.  For enhanced inclusiveness and sustainability, the interventions aim to set the stage for better integration of climatic risks and resilience objectives into development planning at the island level. The strategy will also emphasize community participation in the assessment, monitoring and stewardship of key resources such as fisheries and coral reefs. Furthermore the strategy will seek to address shortcomings in the management of sewage and solid waste management that pose a threat to fresh water sources and marine life. In parallel, the interventions on renewable energy will focus on increasing PV generation through private investment.  \\n . 1.2.1 Targeted island representatives in the Addu Atoll and Gnaviyani Atoll  that demonstrate improved capacities to plan and manage multi-sectoral measures Baseline: 0% of Targeted island representatives demonstrate improved capacities to plan and manage multi-sectoral measures (2015)   Target:    50% of Targeted island representatives demonstrate improved capacities to plan and manage multi-sectoral measures  (2018)   \\n \\n1.2.2 Integrated Waste Management Centers in Fuvahmulah and Hithadhoo are operational Baseline:  0  (2015)   Target:     2  (2018)   \\n \\n1.2.3 Increasing photovoltaic (PV) generation in the Maldives through  private investment  Baseline:  2 MW  (2015)   Target:    10 MW (2019)\", \n\"Improving the efficacy of <span id = \"word\">Public</span> finance management and policy making.

"para": "Enhancing employability and economic opportunities for Maldivians . The limited ability of the population to seize economic opportunities, particularly in the fast-growing tourism industry, is due to a host of factors, including: (1) reservation wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs; (3) social norms; (4) lack of adequate transport, (5) and lack of access to finance. Furthermore, progressively more conservative views in the Maldives have had an impact on female labor participation. The lack of growth in fisheries is also an important factor behind the limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction, especially in the atolls, as fisheries represent a significant source of jobs and livelihoods for the Maldivian population. In line with the governments priorities, WBG activities will seek to contribute to enhancing employability and economic opportunities for Maldivians in the productive sectors, building on improved management of the sectors, enhanced access to financial services, and quality education. The proposed interventions in the productive sectors, particularly tourism and fisheries, will aim to contribute to address some of the constraints associated with the demand for skilled labor. Improved access to financial services, especially in the outer atolls, will also be sought in support of entrepreneurial and commercial activities. On the supply side, the interventions in the education sector will aim to help better align skills with the needs of the economy and address some of the constraints faced by the youth and women in participating in the labor market. . 1.1.1 Regulatory framework for sustainable development of the guest house segment of the  tourism sector developed Baseline:  No  (2015)   Target:     Yes (2019)   \n \n1.1.2 Pilot for community-based management schemes for sustainable marine resources launched Baseline:  No  (2015)   Target:     Yes (2019)   \n \n1.1.3 Operable non-bank-led <span id = \"word\">Mobile</span> <span id = \"word\">Money</span> solution launched  Baseline: No solution  (2015)   Target:    Operable solution in place (2018)  \n\n1.1.4 Strategy for Financial Sector Development adopted  Baseline: No  (2015)\n\nTarget: Yes (2018) \n \n1.1.5 Increased survival rates through higher secondary education (grades 1-12) Baseline:  20% (2015)   Target:     27% (2017)   \n \n1.1.6 National Assessments of Learning Outcomes completed Baseline:  First national assessment of cognitive achievement in English and mathematics commenced (2015)   Target:     Two national assessments of cognitive achievement English and Mathematics completed (2017)  \n \n1.1.7 Proportion of atolls in which a system of quality assurance self-evaluations are established and findings incorporated in the implementation of school improvement plans Baseline:  40% (2015)   Target:     80%  (2017)   \n \n1.1.8.
