An ongoing IDA operation will combine livelihood support with women\\x92s empowerment and access to finance and community development. It will target poor households in three regions (Khulna, Mymensing and Barisal) covering 2500 villages in 15 districts.  The program will target 11 percent of the poor population in Bangladesh.  The majority of beneficiaries are women who will strengthen their decision making role in community organizations.

Two-thirds of Bangladesh\\x92s labor force is engaged in agriculture and related activities, and it is the sector hardest hit by climate change.  Agriculture in Bangladesh is characterized by a high yield gap due to weak technology, poor soil fertility, declining agricultural production due to water logging and salinity increase, and high vulnerability to climate shocks. Promoting sustainable intensification and diversification of agricultural technology and delivery of extension services to farmers will help increase agricultural productivity, create jobs and increase incomes. \\n \\nWBG Support:  The WBG program will support the adoption of climate smart technologies to enhance productivity and diversification. IDA financing will aim to deliver improved extension services to farming communities, stronger linkages with research, on-farm demonstrations of new technologies, training and skills development. These initiatives will seek to contribute to increased agricultural productivity of small holder farms and improve their access to markets, with special emphasis on women farmers. The IDA program will cover 57 out of 64 districts and span a broad range of agro-ecological zones across Bangladesh.  These areas were selected based on poverty incidence, prevalence of marginal farmers and stress levels of the agro-ecological environment.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate weather-related hazards which, without adequate adaptation and mitigation measures, will increase the risk of disasters within the delta. Reducing the vulnerability of the poor to natural disaster will help stimulate economic development by facilitating growth of farm and non-farm activities. \n \nWBG Support:  The WBG has a large portfolio focused on addressing climate change and DRM through lending, technical assistance and analytical work.  Interventions will support infrastructure enhancements for housing and shelter in vulnerable coastal areas as well as improved embankment infrastructure to protect against flooding.  These include cyclone Sidr-affected districts and coastal areas.  Support will also be provided for long term preparedness, system improvement and capacity building. A new operation will complement these efforts to strengthen the governments capacity to deliver reliable weather forecasting and data to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters. . 3.1.1 Number of wards with decentralized emergency response <span id = \"word\">Services</span> in Dhaka and Sylhet26 Baseline: 0 (2015) Target: 68 (Dhaka); 20 (Sylhet) (2020) \n \n3.1.2  Additional people with access to multipurpose shelters in vulnerable coastal districts by 2020 Baseline: 0 (2015) Target:1,200,000 o/w 50% female (2020) \n \n3.1.3 Number of people protected from tidal and storm surges in select areas Baseline: 0 (2015) Target: 760,000 o/w 50% female (2020) \n \n"
