The SCD\\x92s poverty analytics and Moldova\\x92s 2020 vision statement emphasize the need for Moldova\\x92s poverty reduction to shift from a\\ngrowth model based on remittances and pensions to one based on private sector job-creation. However, business survey data (BEEPS, Cost of Doing\\nBusiness) show that growth in private employment is constrained by the corrupt and unequal treatment of businesses by state institutions. Several Bank Group\\ninterventions will therefore seek to reduce the scope for corruption by supporting the development and implementation of a simplified regulatory framework\\nfor business, and by measuring the performance of supervisory institutions. The Competitiveness Enhancement Project II will support a One-Stop Shop and\\nthe measurement of institutional performance and compliance costs. IFC will continue to advise on regulatory simplification under the <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> <span id = \"word\">Climate</span>\\nReform Project and the <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> component of the Economic Rule of Law Project. The latter will also support alternative dispute resolution\\nmechanisms and the enforcement of commercial court decisions.

Moldovas vulnerability to climate-related shocks is substantial with, in some recent cases, significant adverse impacts on the economy. The 2015 summer\ndrought, for example, affected agricultural and overall GDP and household consumption. By at least one widely recognized global measure, Moldova ranks as\nthe most climate vulnerable country in Europe based on a range of economic and social indicators, including low adaptation capacity.\nIntervention logic: The proposed Climate Adaptation project will support the adoption of climate resilient practices in agriculture, <span id = \"word\">Forestry</span> and pasture\nmanagement in targeted landscapes and, in addition, strengthen the countrys national disaster management system. This project fulfills Moldovas\ncommitment under IDA17 to undertake a climate change investment program. Synergies are built with the ongoing Moldova Agriculture Competitiveness\nproject, and new ASA will inform further opportunities for adoption of climate-adaptive agricultural practices. In agribusiness, IFC will continue to assess\npossible new engagements to enhance the production and export potential of key commodities and increase productivity and standardization in value chains,\nmaking farmers more resilient to climate risk. Expected outcomes include the extension of climate-resilient land management, the expansion of capitalintensive\nagriculture, and quicker response to climate-related disasters..

IFC will continue to advise on regulatory simplification under the Investment Climate\\nReform Project <span id = \"word\">and</span> the investment climate component of the Economic Rule of Law Project. The latter will also support alternative dispute resolution\\nmechanisms <span id = \"word\">and</span> the enforcement of commercial court decisions. An Economic Governance DPO will support a reduction in the number of trade\\nauthorizations <span id = \"word\">and</span> the automatic registration of farm inputs which are in the EU catalogue. Expected outcomes during the next 2-3 years include a less\\nburdensome business regulatory framework, in particular regarding licenses, permits <span id = \"word\">and</span> inspections, processes <span id = \"word\">and</span> procedures around trade logistics, <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\npolicies towards Foreign Direct Investments.. Indicator 1: Cost savings from reduced regulatory\\nburden on businesses (annual measurement using\\ncompliance cost saving methodology of T&C GP)\\nBaseline: 0 (FY17)\\nTarget: US$9,000,000 (FY20)\", \n\"Strengthened management of public sector assets. The SCD highlights the need to raise the efficiency of public spending, notably through improved accountability <span id = \"word\">and</span> transparency. Within\\nthis broad objective, it is a government priority to improve its financial control over, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the financial performance of state-owned assets, including real estate\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Poor financial reporting of causes revenue loss <span id = \"word\">and</span> facilitates corruption, while the commercial losses <span id = \"word\">and</span> subsidization\\nof SOEs together cost over 4 percent of GDP. A new inventory of public assets will be supported by the L<span id = \"word\">and</span> Registration, Valuation <span id = \"word\">and</span> Local Taxation\\nProject, the Economic Rule of Law Project (EU) <span id = \"word\">and</span> a UK-funded TF. Improved financial control over SOEs will be supported by the aforementioned EU <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nUK TFs, while the Bank will advise on privatization policy, possibly supported by IFC transactional advice. The financial sustainability of energy utilities will\\nbe supported by tariff-related activities in the District Heating Efficiency Improvement Project, the Economic Governance DPO <span id = \"word\">and</span> several ASAs. A health\\npublic expenditure review will estimate the costs of operating the hospital network under different scenarios. Expected outcomes include: improved SOE\\nfinancial management <span id = \"word\">and</span> governance principles compliant with international st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards, better control <span id = \"word\">and</span> transparency of public assets, <span id = \"word\">and</span> greater financial\\nsustainability in the energy sector..

A massive bank fraud in 2013-14 enabled by political interference with the supervision function led to depreciation of the currency,\\ninflation, financial destabilization <span id = \"word\">and</span> loss of investor confidence. Fiscal <span id = \"word\">and</span> monetary stabilization measures, along with the suspension of external budget\\nassistance, constrained private investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> contributed to a recession. It is therefore important for macroeconomic stability, investor confidence, <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> political economy that the authorities stabilize the financial sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve credit dem<span id = \"word\">and</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> access by strengthening regulation, governance <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\ntransparency of ownership, <span id = \"word\">and</span> sanction those responsible for fraud. ASA, in partnership with the IMF <span id = \"word\">and</span> the Economic Governance DPO, will support more\\nrigorous bank supervision, with a focus on governance <span id = \"word\">and</span> related-party lending, <span id = \"word\">and</span> insurance regulation.

The ongoing Education Reform project, including the additional financing\nunder consideration, will be supplemented by a planned Skills for Jobs project designed to address the education and training-labor market mismatch directly.\nIt will be preceded by significant analytical work, including an education public expenditure review and notes on labor demand and supply, informality and\nself-employment, and private sector skill demand. Planned outcomes under this focus area include: increased efficiency and quality of the primary and\nsecondary system overall, measured by the number of schools achieving minimum education standards, better teacher/student ratios, and increased occupancy;\nand more and better-quality data on the demand for, and supply of skills.

The SCD and the FY16 Public Finance Review identified serious inefficiencies in the provision of public social, administrative and\\ninfrastructural services, leading to a disconnect between their high share of GDP and outcomes often below regional comparators. Deficiencies in\\naccountability and transparency, as well as the influence of special interests over resource allocation, are key constraints upon these sectors\\x92 efficiency. Bank\\nGroup interventions will support transparency and resource-optimization. The Tax Administration Modernization Project (FY16) will support transparency\\nand efficiency through digitization and organizational change. The Health Transformation Project will incentivize a shift from hospital- to primary-based care.\\nThe Land Registration, Valuation and Local Taxation Project will help create transparent registries of land ownership, valuations and public real estate, as\\nwell as improving local governments\\x92 administrative capacity to manage revenue. IFC will assess possibilities to support private sector participation in energy\\n(generation and transmission) through investments and transaction advisory services. The Transparent Power Market Project, the UK Good Governance Fund\\nand the Economic Governance DPO will together support rules-based and competitive electricity trading, by introducing Romania as a new source of supply,\\nand supporting private sector participation in electricity distribution and possibly privatization of generation and/or transmission. The Commitment to Equity\\nstudy and Health and Education public expenditure reviews will identify options to increase the poverty-focus of public spending within a fiscal envelope\\nagreed with the IMF.
