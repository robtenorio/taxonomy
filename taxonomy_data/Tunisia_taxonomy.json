The WBG will assist the Government in addressing the urgent need to improve access to\\nand quality of services, in both the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Tunisia\\x92s rapidly\\ngrowing cities and the country\\x92s deprived rural areas.

IBRD will consider renewing\\nits water sector engagement through an FY18 operation subject to satisfactory performance\\nof the on-going operation in the sector. The upcoming water operation would strengthen\\nthe institutional framework including financial sustainability of rural water and sanitation\\nutilities to help address the growing threats of water insecurity in a context of climate\\nchange and growing demands. IFC stands ready to support the Government in bringing\\nprivate investment into key sectors such as power (including renewables), water, and\\ntransport (including economically viable ports and logistics centers), drawing on its\\nexperience in other parts of the MENA region where successful PPP transactions have\\ntaken place. The implementation of a new legal framework for private renewable energy\\nprojects (beyond self-production schemes), combined with STEG\\x92s willingness to support\\nsuch projects, and/or the revival of IPPs by STEG, would provide significant opportunities\\nfor IFC-supported private investments in this area..

The WBG will continue to pursue implementation of key reforms in Tunisia\\x92s\\nfinancial sector to promote economic growth and employment creation.

The\\nengagement will specifically target financial inclusion issues for disadvantaged groups (youth,\\nwomen, lagging regions). WBG support for improving the competitiveness of the private and financial sectors\\nwill continue through high-impact advisory services and key IFC investments in value-added\\nsectors. WBG advisory services will be provided within the new integrated WBG Global Practices\\nfor Trade and Competitiveness (T&C) and Finance and Markets (F&M), and will focus on\\nimproving sector competitiveness, as well as on legal and regulatory frameworks for secured\\ntransactions and business exits. In addition, as market opportunities arise, IFC will continue its\\ninvestments in trade finance, microfinance, SME banking, SME equity funds, specialized debt\\nrestructuring institutions, financial inclusion and financial technology-related investments. More\\nspecifically, IFC will continue to support the microfinance institutions to enhance their outreach\\nto underserved segments of the population and help them cope with a changing market\\nenvironment, socio-economic and regulatory conditions, and new technologies. IFC will also seek\\nto support the transformation of microfinance organizations into more financially viable financial\\ninstitutions, as well as provide advisory services for establishing green field microfinance\\ninstitutions to encourage new entrants into the microfinance sector. Finally, IFC will look to\\nsupport banks in the area of non-performing loan (NPL) management, and to introduce new\\nproducts such as Sustainable Energy Financing, drawing on regional expertise in this area to\\nsupport climate-friendly lending by the financial sector..

This assistance will include:\\nStrengthening decentralized service delivery by (a) establishing a system of\\nperformance-based fiscal transfers to local governments; (b) strengthening the back-office\\nfunctions of local governments to improve their ability to deliver local services and\\ninfrastructure; (c) developing tools and platforms for citizens to participate in prioritization\\nand monitoring of local service delivery investment, management, operation and\\nmaintenance; and (d) encouraging women\\x92s participation in municipal councils.\\nMaximizing the impact of existing programs that address service delivery in lagging\\nregions by (a) identifying coordinated delivery mechanisms based on lessons from\\nsuccessful on-going operations in country; and (b) creating synergies in monitoring and\\nreporting aligned with the ongoing Government program of decentralization and local\\ndevelopment.\\nIncreasing private sector participation in basic service delivery.
