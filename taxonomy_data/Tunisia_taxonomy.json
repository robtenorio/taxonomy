IFC stands ready to support the Government in bringing\nprivate investment into key sectors such as power (including renewables), water, and\ntransport (including economically viable ports and logistics centers), drawing on its\nexperience in other parts of the MENA region where successful PPP transactions have\ntaken place. The implementation of a new legal framework for private renewable energy\nprojects (beyond self-production schemes), combined with STEGs willingness to support\nsuch projects, and/or the revival of IPPs by STEG, would provide significant opportunities\nfor IFC-supported private investments in this area..
