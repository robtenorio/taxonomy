Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, and the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; and (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women and <span id = \"word\">Youth</span>, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant growth impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector and micro and small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market and should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma and, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children and elderly, and closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, institutions like the National <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> Service and the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers and employers, and on providing high quality services to beneficiaries and employers.

A stable, efficient and accessible financial sector is a necessary condition for private sector-led economic growth and shared prosperity. The <span id = \"word\">Banking</span> sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; and the role of state in the <span id = \"word\">Banking</span> sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit growth, jeopardizes their profitability of and presents a systemic risk for the <span id = \"word\">Banking</span> sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, and lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs and debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> and managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the <span id = \"word\">Banking</span> sector. The IMF, as part of its current standby facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD and the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia.

This engagement will be continued throughout the CPF period, supplemented by a proposed Financial Sector Operation and additional analytical work to address the insolvency issue. The WBG strategy in the financial sector in Serbia also aims to support the return of access to finance for small and medium sized enterprises and individuals. In the context of WBG engagement, IFC will directly support the financial sector through a set of products and instruments: First, IFC will look for opportunities to help will any systemic restructuring and resolution of NPLs in Serbia. IFC began an advisory project in November 2014 with the Government of Serbia to implementing the Debt Resolution Program that is addressing the above-mentioned issues, with primary focus on the legislation that would provide for better debt resolution, allowing for better out-of-court restructuring and sustaining feasible businesses. A component of the advisory work also focuses on the training of judges in foreclosure proceedings. The IFC advisory projects are now being implemented within the Finance and Markets Global Practice..

The state looms overly large in the Serbian economy and its presence needs to be reduced to create space for private sector-led growth. The continued presence of a large number of ineffective and mostly insolvent commercial SOEs poses a disincentive to potential investors, a serious distortion to the <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> <span id = \"word\">Climate</span>, and comes at significant cost to the budget. Scarce resources that could be used to attract <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> and create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities and transport companies (by not paying bills due) and to the health and social insurance funds (by not paying contributions). Fiscally, the sovereign guarantees required by these SOEs create a vicious cycle of underperformance and fiscal drain. The government has made privatization of commercial a centerpiece of its program and policies. Given the fundamental challenge SOEs in their current form pose to economic growth and inclusion, support to this agenda will be a central element of the WBG lending and analytical program. Budget support instruments to support reforms will be used to support the reform agenda to the extent feasible. This includes the SOE DPL series to complete privatization of commercial SOEs, and Public Expenditure Management DPL or RBF to address redundancy issues. Hands on TA and advisory support will continue through the program period, including post-privatization support. This includes advice and support related to increase in number of participants in public works in regions where most of SOEs were located. According to the SOE DPL1 the number of participants in public works will increases from 2,882 in 2013 (1,187 female and 1,695 male) to at least 6,000 in 2015. .

Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, and Road Rehabilitation and Safety. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway and to put in place an effective system of managing and maintaining other major national roads. This engagement builds on a long standing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector. As regards Corridor X, many sections of the Corridor X motorways south of Belgrade are under construction and are expected to be completed in the next few years with the exception of a 6 km section that was to be funded by the Hellenic Fund. Other than this section, resources have been committed by the Government of Serbia and international financial institutions (IFIs) for the completion of the motorways. This engagement will be complemented by IFC advisory support on PPPs and infrastructure concessions, in roads, airports and other facilities. In addition to road and rail connectivity, the WBG will also support Serbia\\x92s further integration in European energy networks. This will enhance efficiency and reduce cost, and through this helps enhancing EPS financial sustainability and mitigating climate change impact.

A stable, efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> accessible financial sector is a necessary condition for private sector-led economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> shared prosperity. The Banking sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; <span id = \"word\">and</span> the role of state in the banking sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, jeopardizes their profitability of <span id = \"word\">and</span> presents a systemic risk for the banking sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia. The WBG has a broad engagement in financial sector reform, through IFC investments in two state owned banks under privatization, through a support operation to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency <span id = \"word\">and</span> through various advisory initiatives on Banking Supervision <span id = \"word\">and</span> Regulation <span id = \"word\">and</span> to address the high ratio of Non-Performing Loans. This engagement will be continued throughout the CPF period, supplemented by a proposed Financial Sector Operation <span id = \"word\">and</span> additional analytical work to address the insolvency issue.

The Banking sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; <span id = \"word\">and</span> the role of state in the banking sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, jeopardizes their profitability of <span id = \"word\">and</span> presents a systemic risk for the banking sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia.

The authorities adopted an ambitious program (supported by the IMF) in January 2015 to halt the rise in public debt <span id = \"word\">and</span> put it on a downward trajectory by 2017. The program is outlined in the recently approved Fiscal Strategy 2015-17 <span id = \"word\">and</span> it includes actions aimed at: i) improving efficiency of public spending, enhancing revenue measures, ensuring financial sustainability of large SOEs (utilities <span id = \"word\">and</span> transport) thus reducing the need for new subsidies <span id = \"word\">and</span> eliminating quasi fiscal deficits; ii) strengthening public financial management, including public investment management <span id = \"word\">and</span> public debt management; <span id = \"word\">and</span> iii) maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector.

Such a scenario would adversely impact <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> risk future cuts in core public expenditures if a sharp fiscal adjustment is then required. The WBG will support the government\\x92s fiscal consolidation <span id = \"word\">and</span> expenditure management efforts through a range of instruments, including Development Policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> Result Based financing, throughout the CPF period in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through in-efficient ad hoc expenditures, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the expenditure program is in line with the medium-term fiscal strategy.

While some of the issues in this area are related to the performance of SOEs (<span id = \"word\">and</span> are addressed directly under CPF Objectives 1c <span id = \"word\">and</span> 1d), there are broader aspects that need attention, such as sector management, physical investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> partnerships with the private sector.

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, <span id = \"word\">and</span> even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> micro <span id = \"word\">and</span> small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market <span id = \"word\">and</span> should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma <span id = \"word\">and</span>, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children <span id = \"word\">and</span> elderly, <span id = \"word\">and</span> closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> like the National Employment Service <span id = \"word\">and</span> the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers <span id = \"word\">and</span> employers, <span id = \"word\">and</span> on providing high quality services to beneficiaries <span id = \"word\">and</span> employers. The WBG interventions in this area will explicitly focus on disadvantaged groups in the labor market, in particular the transition generation, women, youth, workers released by SOEs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Roma.

The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses <span id = \"word\">and</span> investors. Low trust in institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in public sector governance is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Government\\x92s program <span id = \"word\">and</span> for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The Public Sector Reform Strategy <span id = \"word\">and</span> Action Plan, adopted in 2014 <span id = \"word\">and</span> 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) <span id = \"word\">and</span> the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of public administration <span id = \"word\">and</span> service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG <span id = \"word\">and</span> the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on Public Financial Review, Public Expenditure <span id = \"word\">and</span> Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural <span id = \"word\">and</span> functional organization of the public administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The Public Sector Employment <span id = \"word\">and</span> Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional <span id = \"word\">and</span> performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive <span id = \"word\">and</span> export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, <span id = \"word\">and</span> will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts.

A stable, efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> accessible financial sector is a necessary condition for private sector-led economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> shared prosperity. The Banking sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; <span id = \"word\">and</span> the role of state in the banking sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, jeopardizes their profitability of <span id = \"word\">and</span> presents a systemic risk for the banking sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia. The WBG has a broad engagement in financial sector reform, through IFC investments in two state owned banks under privatization, through a support operation to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency <span id = \"word\">and</span> through various advisory initiatives on Banking Supervision <span id = \"word\">and</span> Regulation <span id = \"word\">and</span> to address the high ratio of Non-Performing Loans.

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process <span id = \"word\">and</span> institutional fragmentation st<span id = \"word\">and</span> out as fundamental challenges to Serbia\\x92s ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses <span id = \"word\">and</span> investors. Low trust in institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in public sector <span id = \"word\">Governance</span> is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Government\\x92s program <span id = \"word\">and</span> for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The Public Sector Reform Strategy <span id = \"word\">and</span> Action Plan, adopted in 2014 <span id = \"word\">and</span> 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) <span id = \"word\">and</span> the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of public administration <span id = \"word\">and</span> service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG <span id = \"word\">and</span> the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on Public Financial Review, Public Expenditure <span id = \"word\">and</span> Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural <span id = \"word\">and</span> functional organization of the public administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The Public Sector Employment <span id = \"word\">and</span> Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional <span id = \"word\">and</span> performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive <span id = \"word\">and</span> export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, <span id = \"word\">and</span> will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts. Capacity development <span id = \"word\">and</span> institution building on Disaster Risk Management will also be provided to enhance the government\\x92s forecasting <span id = \"word\">and</span> response capacity for climate-induced disasters. .

Connectivity is a critical driver of competitiveness, especially considering Serbia\\x92s objective to transform the economy towards export-orientation. Serbia continues to suffer from significant infrastructure gaps, which hinders the country\\x92s ability to attract <span id = \"word\">and</span> retain investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> stifles development opportunities in the rural areas where a large portion of the B40 reside.

While some of the issues in this area are related to the performance of SOEs (<span id = \"word\">and</span> are addressed directly under CPF Objectives 1c <span id = \"word\">and</span> 1d), there are broader aspects that need attention, such as sector management, physical investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> partnerships with the private sector. Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Road Rehabilitation <span id = \"word\">and</span> Safety. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway <span id = \"word\">and</span> to put in place an effective system of managing <span id = \"word\">and</span> maintaining other major national roads. This engagement builds on a long st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector. As regards Corridor X, many sections of the Corridor X motorways south of Belgrade are under construction <span id = \"word\">and</span> are expected to be completed in the next few years with the exception of a 6 km section that was to be funded by the Hellenic Fund. Other than this section, resources have been committed by the Government of Serbia <span id = \"word\">and</span> international financial institutions (IFIs) for the completion of the motorways. This engagement will be complemented by IFC advisory support on PPPs <span id = \"word\">and</span> infrastructure concessions, in roads, airports <span id = \"word\">and</span> other facilities. In addition to road <span id = \"word\">and</span> rail connectivity, the WBG will also support Serbia\\x92s further integration in European energy networks. This will enhance efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> reduce cost, <span id = \"word\">and</span> through this helps enhancing EPS financial sustainability <span id = \"word\">and</span> mitigating climate change impact.

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, and even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, and the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; and (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women and youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant growth impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector and micro and small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market and should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma and, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children and elderly, and closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, institutions like the National Employment Service and the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers and employers, and on providing high quality services to beneficiaries and employers. The WBG interventions in this area will explicitly focus on disadvantaged groups in the labor market, in particular the transition generation, women, youth, workers released by SOEs, and Roma. The social pillar of the SOE DPL series, and the Competitiveness and Jobs RBF will be the main instruments to support the labor market reform agenda. The WBG program will also continue to work on strengthening Serbia\\x92s innovation and technology transfer systems as a way to enhance labor market opportunities in the long term, in particular for youth.  .

The regulation and management of land and property markets in Serbia remain below European Standards, creating serious impediments to investments and economic growth. Security of property rights is a crucial building block of successful market economies. Real property itself is a key input to most production and investment processes, as well as a foundation for social stability and people\\x92s well-being. Over the last decade important improvements in Serbia\\x92s land administration, have been made, such as creation of unified register or real estate and real estate rights (supported through the WB-funded Real Estate Cadaster and Registration Project). However, the data on land, ownership, buildings, utility lines, etc., need to be made complete and more easily accessible. Reforming the process of issuing construction permit is critical for enabling investments in land and property, as investors watch the developments in construction permitting as they are related to important indicators such as employment and financing. In this area, it is particularly important to address gender aspects of property registration and records. Women entrepreneurs are particularly affected as properties are almost invariably registered to males, making it extremely difficult for female entrepreneurs to access credit. WBG support under this objective will continue to be provided by the Real Estate Management Project and IFC advisory services. .

Connectivity is a critical driver of competitiveness, especially considering Serbia\\x92s objective to transform the economy towards export-orientation. Serbia continues to suffer from significant infrastructure gaps, which hinders the country\\x92s ability to attract and retain investments and stifles development opportunities in the rural areas where a large portion of the B40 reside. There is both a need and a large potential for the improvement in the quality of Serbia\\x92s transport infrastructure and services and the in the efficiency of resource use and service delivery. While some of the issues in this area are related to the performance of SOEs (and are addressed directly under CPF Objectives 1c and 1d), there are broader aspects that need attention, such as sector management, physical investments and partnerships with the private sector. Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, and Road Rehabilitation and Safety. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway and to put in place an effective system of managing and maintaining other major national roads. This engagement builds on a long standing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector. As regards Corridor X, many sections of the Corridor X motorways south of Belgrade are under construction and are expected to be completed in the next few years with the exception of a 6 km section that was to be funded by the Hellenic Fund. Other than this section, resources have been committed by the Government of Serbia and international <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> (IFIs) for the completion of the motorways. This engagement will be complemented by IFC advisory support on PPPs and infrastructure concessions, in roads, airports and other facilities. In addition to road and rail connectivity, the WBG will also support Serbia\\x92s further integration in European energy networks. This will enhance efficiency and reduce cost, and through this helps enhancing EPS <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> sustainability and mitigating climate change impact. In addition to an IBRD lending engagement on energy sector governance, IFC will consider support to energy sector diversification to broaden Serbia\\x92s energy mix. .

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, and even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, and the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; and (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women and youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant growth impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector and micro and small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market and should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma and, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children and elderly, and closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> like the National Employment Service and the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers and employers, and on providing high quality services to beneficiaries and employers. The WBG interventions in this area will explicitly focus on disadvantaged groups in the labor market, in particular the transition generation, women, youth, workers released by SOEs, and Roma. The social pillar of the SOE DPL series, and the Competitiveness and Jobs RBF will be the main instruments to support the labor market reform agenda. The WBG program will also continue to work on strengthening Serbia\\x92s innovation and technology transfer systems as a way to enhance labor market opportunities in the long term, in particular for youth.  .

While in the short term skill supply is not a critical constraint to investment and economic development, any uptick in demand will generate skill shortages in sectors that are potential drivers of growth. While in the medium term this skill gap can be closed by reforming and enhancing vocational education and training programs, the best long term investment strategy for Serbia is to improve the access and quality of Early Childhood Education, which, while mandatory, only sees participation of a fraction of poor and disadvantaged households. The latter would also have a positive impact on female labor market participation as universal Early Childhood Education would make it easier for women to seek employment, especially for women in single female headed households.

The Public Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of public administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on Public Financial Review, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the public administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The Public Sector Employment and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, and will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts.

Absent fiscal consolidation there is a clear risk that government debt will be on an unsustainable path, raising risk premiums <span id = \"word\">and</span> financing costs, with the potential for disruptions to the government\\x92s access to financing <span id = \"word\">and</span> for increased macro-fiscal instability. Such a scenario would adversely impact <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> risk future cuts in core public expenditures if a sharp fiscal adjustment is then required. The WBG will support the government\\x92s fiscal consolidation <span id = \"word\">and</span> expenditure management efforts through a range of instruments, including Development Policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> Result Based financing, throughout the CPF period in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through in-efficient ad hoc expenditures, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the expenditure program is in line with the medium-term fiscal strategy. The SOE DPL series, the Public Expenditure <span id = \"word\">and</span> Utilities Reform DPL series, the Public Expenditure Management DPLs/RBFs will all be contributing to this CPF Objective. Prior action areas of the budget support operations are also supported through several TF financed TA projects <span id = \"word\">and</span> closely coordinated with the EU, the IMF <span id = \"word\">and</span> other European development partners. The design of financing operations will be informed by in-depth analytical work <span id = \"word\">and</span> TA activities which also directly contribute to this objective. For example, engagement on cost savings on the public sector wage bill will further contribute to medium term fiscal sustainability.

A stable, efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> accessible financial sector is a necessary condition for private sector-led economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> shared prosperity. The Banking sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; <span id = \"word\">and</span> the role of state in the banking sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, jeopardizes their profitability of <span id = \"word\">and</span> presents a systemic risk for the banking sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia. The WBG has a broad engagement in financial sector reform, through IFC investments in two state owned banks under privatization, through a support operation to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency <span id = \"word\">and</span> through various advisory initiatives on Banking Supervision <span id = \"word\">and</span> Regulation <span id = \"word\">and</span> to address the high ratio of Non-Performing Loans. This engagement will be continued throughout the CPF period, supplemented by a proposed Financial Sector Operation <span id = \"word\">and</span> additional analytical work to address the insolvency issue. The WBG strategy in the financial sector in Serbia also aims to support the return of access to finance for small <span id = \"word\">and</span> medium sized enterprises <span id = \"word\">and</span> individuals. In the context of WBG engagement, IFC will directly support the financial sector through a set of products <span id = \"word\">and</span> instruments: First, IFC will look for opportunities to help will any systemic restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> resolution of NPLs in Serbia. IFC began an advisory project in November 2014 with the Government of Serbia to implementing the Debt Resolution Program that is addressing the above-mentioned issues, with primary focus on the legislation that would provide for better debt resolution, allowing for better out-of-court restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustaining feasible businesses. A component of the advisory work also focuses on the training of judges in foreclosure proceedings. The IFC advisory projects are now being implemented within the Finance <span id = \"word\">and</span> Markets Global Practice..

Connectivity is a critical driver of competitiveness, especially considering Serbia\\x92s objective to transform the economy towards export-orientation. Serbia continues to suffer from significant infrastructure gaps, which hinders the country\\x92s ability to attract <span id = \"word\">and</span> retain investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> stifles development opportunities in the rural areas where a large portion of the B40 reside. There is both a need <span id = \"word\">and</span> a large potential for the improvement in the quality of Serbia\\x92s transport infrastructure <span id = \"word\">and</span> services <span id = \"word\">and</span> the in the efficiency of resource use <span id = \"word\">and</span> service delivery. While some of the issues in this area are related to the performance of SOEs (<span id = \"word\">and</span> are addressed directly under CPF Objectives 1c <span id = \"word\">and</span> 1d), there are broader aspects that need attention, such as sector management, physical investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> partnerships with the private sector. Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Road Rehabilitation <span id = \"word\">and</span> Safety. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway <span id = \"word\">and</span> to put in place an effective system of managing <span id = \"word\">and</span> maintaining other major national roads. This engagement builds on a long st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector. As regards Corridor X, many sections of the Corridor X motorways south of Belgrade are under construction <span id = \"word\">and</span> are expected to be completed in the next few years with the exception of a 6 km section that was to be funded by the Hellenic Fund. Other than this section, resources have been committed by the Government of Serbia <span id = \"word\">and</span> international financial <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> (IFIs) for the completion of the motorways. This engagement will be complemented by IFC advisory support on PPPs <span id = \"word\">and</span> infrastructure concessions, in roads, airports <span id = \"word\">and</span> other facilities. In addition to road <span id = \"word\">and</span> rail connectivity, the WBG will also support Serbia\\x92s further integration in European energy networks. This will enhance efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> reduce cost, <span id = \"word\">and</span> through this helps enhancing EPS financial sustainability <span id = \"word\">and</span> mitigating climate change impact. In addition to an IBRD lending engagement on energy sector governance, IFC will consider support to energy sector diversification to broaden Serbia\\x92s energy mix. .

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, <span id = \"word\">and</span> even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> micro <span id = \"word\">and</span> small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market <span id = \"word\">and</span> should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma <span id = \"word\">and</span>, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children <span id = \"word\">and</span> elderly, <span id = \"word\">and</span> closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> like the National Employment Service <span id = \"word\">and</span> the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers <span id = \"word\">and</span> employers, <span id = \"word\">and</span> on providing high quality services to beneficiaries <span id = \"word\">and</span> employers. The WBG interventions in this area will explicitly focus on disadvantaged groups in the labor market, in particular the transition generation, women, youth, workers released by SOEs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Roma. The social pillar of the SOE DPL series, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the Competitiveness <span id = \"word\">and</span> Jobs RBF will be the main instruments to support the labor market reform agenda. The WBG program will also continue to work on strengthening Serbia\\x92s innovation <span id = \"word\">and</span> technology transfer systems as a way to enhance labor market opportunities in the long term, in particular for youth.  .

Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia. The WBG has a broad engagement in financial sector reform, through IFC investments in two state owned banks under privatization, through a support operation to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency <span id = \"word\">and</span> through various advisory initiatives on Banking Supervision <span id = \"word\">and</span> Regulation <span id = \"word\">and</span> to address the high ratio of Non-Performing Loans. This engagement will be continued throughout the CPF period, supplemented by a proposed Financial Sector Operation <span id = \"word\">and</span> additional analytical work to address the insolvency issue. The WBG strategy in the financial sector in Serbia also aims to support the return of access to <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> for small <span id = \"word\">and</span> medium sized enterprises <span id = \"word\">and</span> individuals. In the context of WBG engagement, IFC will directly support the financial sector through a set of products <span id = \"word\">and</span> instruments: First, IFC will look for opportunities to help will any systemic restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> resolution of NPLs in Serbia. IFC began an advisory project in November 2014 with the Government of Serbia to implementing the Debt Resolution Program that is addressing the above-mentioned issues, with primary focus on the legislation that would provide for better debt resolution, allowing for better out-of-court restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustaining feasible businesses. A component of the advisory work also focuses on the training of judges in foreclosure proceedings. The IFC advisory projects are now being implemented within the <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> Markets Global Practice..

Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Road Rehabilitation <span id = \"word\">and</span> Safety. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway <span id = \"word\">and</span> to put in place an effective system of managing <span id = \"word\">and</span> maintaining other major national roads. This engagement builds on a long st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector.

The authorities adopted an ambitious program (supported by the IMF) in January 2015 to halt the rise in public debt <span id = \"word\">and</span> put it on a downward trajectory by 2017. The program is outlined in the recently approved Fiscal Strategy 2015-17 <span id = \"word\">and</span> it includes actions aimed at: i) improving efficiency of public spending, enhancing revenue measures, ensuring financial sustainability of large SOEs (utilities <span id = \"word\">and</span> transport) thus reducing the need for new subsidies <span id = \"word\">and</span> eliminating quasi fiscal deficits; ii) strengthening public financial management, including public investment management <span id = \"word\">and</span> public debt management; <span id = \"word\">and</span> iii) maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector.

Such a scenario would adversely impact <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> risk future cuts in core public expenditures if a sharp fiscal adjustment is then required. The WBG will support the government\\x92s fiscal consolidation <span id = \"word\">and</span> expenditure management efforts through a range of instruments, including Development Policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> Result Based financing, throughout the CPF period in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through in-efficient ad hoc expenditures, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the expenditure program is in line with the medium-term fiscal strategy. The SOE DPL series, the Public Expenditure <span id = \"word\">and</span> Utilities Reform DPL series, the Public Expenditure Management DPLs/RBFs will all be contributing to this CPF Objective.

The design of financing operations will be informed by in-depth analytical work <span id = \"word\">and</span> TA activities which also directly contribute to this objective. For example, engagement on cost savings on the public sector wage bill will further contribute to medium term fiscal sustainability.

A stable, efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> accessible financial sector is a necessary condition for private sector-led economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> shared prosperity. The Banking sector in Serbia is going through a difficult period, some banks were closed down; non-performing loans have increased; <span id = \"word\">and</span> the role of state in the banking sector remains significant. The chronically high rate of NPLs in Serbia increases banks\\x92 risk aversion, dampens credit <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, jeopardizes their profitability of <span id = \"word\">and</span> presents a systemic risk for the banking sector. Improving the regulatory framework for NPL resolution is critical to decreasing the internal risks that the financial system in Serbia is facing.  Inadequate insolvency proceedings, weak supervision over insolvency administrators, <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of technical knowledge among the judiciary all impede the resolution of NPLs in Serbia. As part of the ambitious program adopted by the Government (supported by the IMF), the Government has committed to maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> managing effectively the government\\x92s ownership stake in the banking sector. The IMF, as part of its current st<span id = \"word\">and</span>by facility is coordinating a working group of IFIs including IFC, EBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span> the World Bank to address the cleanup of the NPL problem in Serbia. The WBG has a broad engagement in financial sector reform, through IFC investments in two state owned banks under privatization, through a support operation to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency <span id = \"word\">and</span> through various advisory initiatives on Banking Supervision <span id = \"word\">and</span> Regulation <span id = \"word\">and</span> to address the high ratio of Non-Performing Loans. This engagement will be continued throughout the CPF period, supplemented by a proposed Financial Sector Operation <span id = \"word\">and</span> additional analytical work to address the insolvency issue. The WBG strategy in the financial sector in Serbia also aims to support the return of access to finance for small <span id = \"word\">and</span> medium sized enterprises <span id = \"word\">and</span> individuals. In the context of WBG engagement, IFC will directly support the financial sector through a set of products <span id = \"word\">and</span> instruments: First, IFC will look for opportunities to help will any systemic restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> resolution of NPLs in Serbia. IFC began an advisory project in November 2014 with the Government of Serbia to implementing the Debt Resolution Program that is addressing the above-mentioned issues, with primary focus on the legislation that would provide for better debt resolution, allowing for better out-of-court restructuring <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustaining feasible businesses.

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, <span id = \"word\">and</span> even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; <span id = \"word\">and</span> (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women <span id = \"word\">and</span> youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> micro <span id = \"word\">and</span> small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work.

While in the medium term this skill gap can be closed by reforming and enhancing vocational education and training programs, the best long term investment strategy for Serbia is to improve the access and quality of Early Childhood Education, which, while mandatory, only sees participation of a fraction of poor and disadvantaged households. The latter would also have a positive impact on female <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> <span id = \"word\">Market</span> participation as universal Early Childhood Education would make it easier for women to seek employment, especially for women in single female headed households.

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process and institutional fragmentation stand out as fundamental challenges to Serbia\\x92s ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social <span id = \"word\">Services</span> or in providing <span id = \"word\">Services</span> to businesses and investors. Low trust in institutions and high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in <span id = \"word\">Public</span> sector governance is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Government\\x92s program and for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Financial Review, <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, and will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts. Capacity development and institution building on Disaster Risk Management will also be provided to enhance the government\\x92s forecasting and response capacity for climate-induced disasters. .

As a small, open middle-income economy, Serbia\\x92s main path to prosperity is to significantly improve its business climate leading to more successful international integration, especially with Europe, through an increase in investments. The business environment is understood in the broad sense, including the administrative and regulatory barriers that are addressed under \\x91Doing Business\\x92 and BEEPS, but also considering broader issues such as connectivity, trade facilitation and access to finance for SMEs. As a demonstration of its commitment to taking a comprehensive approach to developing a more competitive business climate, the Government recently established a Task Force for coordinating and systematically addressing business climate reforms, headed one of the Deputy Prime Ministers. The WBG will support the government in addressing select aspects of the business climate agenda, under this objective the focus will be placed on paying taxes, trading across borders and insolvency procedures. Some other critical priority areas are addressed under objective 2b and 2c. The main support instrument in these three areas will be IFC advisory support, while the IBRD financed Competitiveness and Jobs project will support overall government efforts to address regulatory and administrative constraints, facilitate innovation and technology transfer and improve economic participation overall and for the B40 in particular.  .

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process and institutional fragmentation stand out as fundamental challenges to Serbia\\x92s ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses and investors. Low trust in institutions and high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in <span id = \"word\">Public</span> sector governance is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Government\\x92s program and for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Financial Review, <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector Employment and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, and will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts. Capacity development and institution building on Disaster Risk Management will also be provided to enhance the government\\x92s forecasting and response capacity for climate-induced disasters. .

The state looms overly large in the Serbian economy and its presence needs to be reduced to create space for private sector-led growth. The continued presence of a large number of ineffective and mostly insolvent commercial SOEs poses a disincentive to potential investors, a serious distortion to the investment climate, and comes at significant cost to the budget. Scarce resources that could be used to attract investment and create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities and transport companies (by not paying bills due) and to the health and social insurance funds (by not paying contributions).

Creating a competitive business environment together with labor market strengthening will help achieve the fundamental objectives of boosting growth and shared prosperity by generating meaningful employment, including jobs for the B40. As a small, open middle-income economy, Serbia\\x92s main path to prosperity is to significantly improve its business climate leading to more successful international integration, especially with Europe, through an increase in investments. The business environment is understood in the broad sense, including the administrative and regulatory barriers that are addressed under \\x91Doing Business\\x92 and BEEPS, but also considering broader issues such as connectivity, trade facilitation and access to finance for SMEs. As a demonstration of its commitment to taking a comprehensive approach to developing a more competitive business climate, the Government recently established a Task Force for coordinating and systematically addressing business climate reforms, headed one of the Deputy Prime Ministers. The WBG will support the government in addressing select aspects of the business climate agenda, under this objective the focus will be placed on paying taxes, trading across borders and insolvency procedures. Some other critical priority areas are addressed under objective 2b and 2c. The main support instrument in these three areas will be IFC advisory support, while the IBRD financed Competitiveness and Jobs project will support overall government efforts to address regulatory and administrative constraints, facilitate innovation and technology transfer and improve economic participation overall and for the B40 in particular.  .

More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, and even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, and the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; and (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women and youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant growth impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector and micro and small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum <span id = \"word\">Social</span> security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for part-time work. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of <span id = \"word\">Social</span> benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal work. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market and should help the 40+ generation into work, but also excluded groups like Roma and, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children and elderly, and closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, institutions like the National Employment Service and the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers and employers, and on providing high quality services to beneficiaries and employers.

The state looms overly large in the Serbian economy and its presence needs to be reduced to create space for private sector-led growth. The continued presence of a large number of ineffective and mostly insolvent commercial SOEs poses a disincentive to potential investors, a serious distortion to the investment climate, and comes at significant cost to the budget. Scarce resources that could be used to attract investment and create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities and transport companies (by not paying bills due) and to the health and social insurance funds (by not paying contributions). Fiscally, the sovereign guarantees required by these SOEs create a vicious cycle of underperformance and fiscal drain. The government has made privatization of commercial a centerpiece of its program and policies. Given the fundamental challenge SOEs in their current form pose to economic growth and inclusion, support to this agenda will be a central element of the WBG lending and analytical program. Budget support instruments to support reforms will be used to support the reform agenda to the extent feasible. This includes the SOE DPL series to complete privatization of commercial SOEs, and Public Expenditure Management DPL or RBF to address redundancy issues. Hands on TA and advisory support will continue through the program period, including post-privatization support.

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process and institutional fragmentation stand out as fundamental challenges to Serbia\\x92s ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses and investors. Low trust in institutions and high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in public sector governance is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Government\\x92s program and for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The Public Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of public administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the government\\x92s reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on Public Financial Review, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the government\\x92s rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the public administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The Public Sector Employment and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, and will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts. Capacity development and institution building on <span id = \"word\">Disaster</span> <span id = \"word\">Risk</span> <span id = \"word\">Management</span> will also be provided to enhance the government\\x92s forecasting and response capacity for climate-induced <span id = \"word\">Disaster</span>s. .

The state looms overly large in the Serbian economy and its presence needs to be reduced to create space for private sector-led growth. The continued presence of a large number of ineffective and mostly insolvent commercial SOEs poses a disincentive to potential investors, a serious distortion to the investment climate, and comes at significant cost to the budget. Scarce resources that could be used to attract investment and create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities and transport companies (by not paying bills due) and to the health and social insurance funds (by not paying contributions). Fiscally, the sovereign guarantees required by these SOEs create a vicious cycle of underperformance and fiscal drain. The government has made privatization of commercial a centerpiece of its program and policies. Given the fundamental challenge SOEs in their current form pose to economic growth and inclusion, support to this agenda will be a central element of the WBG lending and analytical program. Budget support instruments to support reforms will be used to support the reform agenda to the extent feasible. This includes the SOE DPL series to complete privatization of commercial SOEs, and Public Expenditure <span id = \"word\">Management</span> DPL or RBF to address redundancy issues. Hands on TA and advisory support will continue through the program period, including post-privatization support. This includes advice and support related to increase in number of participants in public works in regions where most of SOEs were located.

The WGB will invest further to support public <span id = \"word\">Transport</span> SOE corporatization <span id = \"word\">and</span> financial consolidation. Given the complexity of these reforms, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the cost of implementation, budget or result based financing support will be considered along with advisory support. IFC support on the design <span id = \"word\">and</span> implementation of PPPs <span id = \"word\">and</span> potentially concessions will complement IBRD engagement on corporatization <span id = \"word\">and</span> financial consolidation. In these sectors, a series of DPL or RBF engagement should help remove policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> capacity constraints to effective infrastructure investments, which could be followed in the outer years of the CPF period by specific operations to address remaining issues in the railway <span id = \"word\">and</span> road sectors. \\n . Serbia Railways restructured <span id = \"word\">and</span> cargo company operating without subsidies \\n \\nSubsidy to cargo company RSD 10.4 Billion in 2014, <span id = \"word\">and</span> zero in 2019 \\n \\nRoads maintained under Performance based maintenance reaches 3000 kilometers \\n\\nKilometers of roads under performance based maintenance in 2015: 0 Target for 2018: 3000\", \n\"Productive SOE assets transferred to private ownership . The state looms overly large in the Serbian economy <span id = \"word\">and</span> its presence needs to be reduced to create space for private sector-led growth. The continued presence of a large number of ineffective <span id = \"word\">and</span> mostly insolvent commercial SOEs poses a disincentive to potential investors, a serious distortion to the investment climate, <span id = \"word\">and</span> comes at significant cost to the budget. Scarce resources that could be used to attract investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities <span id = \"word\">and</span> <span id = \"word\">Transport</span> companies (by not paying bills due) <span id = \"word\">and</span> to the health <span id = \"word\">and</span> social insurance funds (by not paying contributions). Fiscally, the sovereign guarantees required by these SOEs create a vicious cycle of underperformance <span id = \"word\">and</span> fiscal drain. The government has made privatization of commercial a centerpiece of its program <span id = \"word\">and</span> policies. Given the fundamental challenge SOEs in their current form pose to economic growth <span id = \"word\">and</span> inclusion, support to this agenda will be a central element of the WBG lending <span id = \"word\">and</span> analytical program. Budget support instruments to support reforms will be used to support the reform agenda to the extent feasible. This includes the SOE DPL series to complete privatization of commercial SOEs, <span id = \"word\">and</span> Public Expenditure Management DPL or RBF to address redundancy issues. H<span id = \"word\">and</span>s on TA <span id = \"word\">and</span> advisory support will continue through the program period, including post-privatization support. This includes advice <span id = \"word\">and</span> support related to increase in number of participants in public works in regions where most of SOEs were located. According to the SOE DPL1 the number of participants in public works will increases from 2,882 in 2013 (1,187 female <span id = \"word\">and</span> 1,695 male) to at least 6,000 in 2015. .
