The government has made privatization of commercial a centerpiece of its program and policies. Given the fundamental challenge SOEs in their current form pose to economic growth and inclusion, support to this agenda will be a central element of the WBG lending and analytical program.

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process and institutional fragmentation stand out as fundamental challenges to Serbias ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses and investors. Low trust in institutions and high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in <span id = \"word\">Public</span> sector governance is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Governments program and for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the governments reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Financial Review, <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the governments rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the <span id = \"word\">Public</span> administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The <span id = \"word\">Public</span> Sector Employment and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards.

Implementation deficits, convoluted decision-making process and institutional fragmentation stand out as fundamental challenges to Serbias ability to implement the essential reforms needed to build a competitive inclusive economy. The same factors also account for weak sector service delivery performance, whether it in social services or in providing services to businesses and investors. Low trust in institutions and high levels of politicization further aggravate the systemic problems. Addressing the structural problems in public sector <span id = \"word\">Governance</span> is a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Governments program and for the delivery of the WBG program itself.  The Public Sector Reform Strategy and Action Plan, adopted in 2014 and 2015 respectively, set out a broad reform agenda. An important theme of the Reform Strategy is the rationalization of the overall government architecture (through a horizontal functional audit) and the right sizing of critical sectors. Through the Strategy, the government aims to improve the quality of public administration and service delivery. These efforts will be jointly supported by the WBG and the EU. The CPF will selectively support the governments reform agenda through a combination of instruments, focusing on areas where government has demonstrated the most willingness to reform. Building on ongoing analytical work on Public Financial Review, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), TA on Wage Bill, and Functional Review, the CPF will enhance the governments rationalization agenda by supporting elements of the proposed reforms that would improve government efficiency and service delivery. In addition to focusing on foundational elements of structural and functional organization of the public administration system, the WGB will engage in supporting service delivery improvements in a select number of sectors. The Public Sector Employment and Performance Project will be focused on cross-cutting support to frontline service delivery. A first sectoral focus will be the reform of the overhaul of investment and export incentive systems, which have been largely ineffective in attracting investment. The Government has committed to a functional and performance audit of the three agencies involved in the investment incentive and export promotion system. Second, the MDTF-JSS will continue to provide targeted TA to support the justice sector to align with EU standards. Finally, The Second Health Sector project includes support for sector expenditure rationalization, including broad health sector restructuring, and will also be one of the priority sectors for the government rightsizing efforts. Capacity development and institution building on Disaster Risk Management will also be provided to enhance the governments forecasting and response capacity for climate-induced disasters. .

"para": "Reduced barriers to labor market participation . More than 60 percent of the adult population in Serbia is not employed, and even fewer are formally employed. Not surprisingly, this group of people constitutes the majority of the B40, and the lack of labor income is the key constraint to lifting them out of poverty. They consist mostly of two groups: (i) the (pre-) transition generation; and (ii) certain groups, especially minorities like Roma, but also women and youth, who have never been strongly attached to the labor market. Bringing these people into the labor market is the most critical element of enhancing shared prosperity in Serbia. It would also bring a significant growth impulse to the Serbian economy. Progress on this agenda requires labor market reforms as well as removing obstacles to investment in the non-tradable sector and micro and small enterprises. The first priority in labor market reform is revising the minimum social security contribution. The current design of contributions puts a high burden on low wage earners, especially for <span id = \"word\">Part-Time</span> <span id = \"word\">Work</span>. In addition, there is further need for reform in the design of social benefits, as a number of benefits come with considerable disincentives for formal <span id = \"word\">Work</span>. Combined, these reforms should be the crucial first step to unlock the potential of a new segment in the Serbian labor market and should help the 40+ generation into <span id = \"word\">Work</span>, but also excluded groups like Roma and, importantly, women. For the latter, additional measures, like providing care facilities for children and elderly, and closing skill gaps might be necessary. Importantly, institutions like the National Employment Service and the active labor market programs (ALMPs) it provides need to be considerably strengthened. The focus needs to be on ensuring efficient match-making between job seekers and employers, and on providing high quality services to beneficiaries and employers. The WBG interventions in this area will explicitly focus on disadvantaged groups in the labor market, in particular the transition generation, women, youth, <span id = \"word\">Work</span>ers released by SOEs, and Roma. The social pillar of the SOE DPL series, and the Competitiveness and Jobs RBF will be the main instruments to support the labor market reform agenda.

Scarce resources that could be used to attract investment and create jobs are instead diverted to prop up loss making SOEs. These same SOEs cause losses in utilities and transport companies (by not paying bills due) and to the health and social insurance funds (by not paying contributions).

Sustainable fiscal consolidation and expenditure management is a key prerequisite for macroeconomic stability and growth, and for creating the enabling environment for the delivery of other CPF objectives. The authorities adopted an ambitious program (supported by the IMF) in January 2015 to halt the rise in public debt and put it on a downward trajectory by 2017. The program is outlined in the recently approved Fiscal Strategy 2015-17 and it includes actions aimed at: i) improving efficiency of public spending, enhancing revenue measures, ensuring financial sustainability of large SOEs (utilities and transport) thus reducing the need for new subsidies and eliminating quasi fiscal deficits; ii) strengthening public financial management, including public investment management and public debt management; and iii) maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs and debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions and managing effectively the governments ownership stake in the banking sector. Absent fiscal consolidation there is a clear risk that government debt will be on an unsustainable path, raising risk premiums and financing costs, with the potential for disruptions to the governments access to financing and for increased macro-fiscal instability. Such a scenario would adversely impact growth and risk future cuts in core public expenditures if a sharp fiscal adjustment is then required. The WBG will support the governments fiscal consolidation and expenditure management efforts through a range of instruments, including Development Policy and Result Based financing, throughout the CPF period in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through in-efficient ad hoc expenditures, and the expenditure program is in line with the medium-term fiscal strategy. The SOE DPL series, the Public Expenditure and Utilities Reform DPL series, the Public Expenditure Management DPLs/RBFs will all be contributing to this CPF Objective.

The program is outlined in the recently approved Fiscal Strategy 2015-17 and it includes actions aimed at: i) improving efficiency of public spending, enhancing revenue measures, ensuring financial sustainability of large SOEs (utilities and <span id = \"word\">Transport</span>) thus reducing the need for new <span id = \"word\">Subsidies</span> and eliminating quasi fiscal deficits; ii) strengthening public financial management, including public investment management and public debt management; and iii) maintaining financial sector stability through reducing NPLs and debt resolution, strengthening financial sector supervisory institutions and managing effectively the governments ownership stake in the banking sector. Absent fiscal consolidation there is a clear risk that government debt will be on an unsustainable path, raising risk premiums and financing costs, with the potential for disruptions to the governments access to financing and for increased macro-fiscal instability. Such a scenario would adversely impact growth and risk future cuts in core public expenditures if a sharp fiscal adjustment is then required. The WBG will support the governments fiscal consolidation and expenditure management efforts through a range of instruments, including Development Policy and Result Based financing, throughout the CPF period in order to ensure that the consolidation process is not undermined through in-efficient ad hoc expenditures, and the expenditure program is in line with the medium-term fiscal strategy. The SOE DPL series, the Public Expenditure and Utilities Reform DPL series, the Public Expenditure Management DPLs/RBFs will all be contributing to this CPF Objective. Prior action areas of the budget support operations are also supported through several TF financed TA projects and closely coordinated with the EU, the IMF and other European development partners. The design of financing operations will be informed by in-depth analytical work and TA activities which also directly contribute to this objective. For example, engagement on cost savings on the public sector wage bill will further contribute to medium term fiscal sustainability. Improving public investment management and management of PPPs is important for ensuring that scaling up public investment supports macro-fiscal stability and growth.

"para": "Enhanced infrastructure networks . Connectivity is a critical driver of competitiveness, especially considering Serbias objective to transform the economy towards export-orientation. Serbia continues to suffer from significant infrastructure gaps, which hinders the countrys ability to attract and retain investments and stifles development opportunities in the rural areas where a large portion of the B40 reside. There is both a need and a large potential for the improvement in the quality of Serbias transport infrastructure and services and the in the efficiency of resource use and service delivery. While some of the issues in this area are related to the performance of SOEs (and are addressed directly under CPF Objectives 1c and 1d), there are b<span id = \"word\">Road</span>er aspects that need attention, such as sector management, physical investments and partnerships with the private sector. Under the CPF, the WBG will continue to pursue two critical ongoing infrastructure projects, Corridor X, and <span id = \"word\">Road</span> Rehabilitation and <span id = \"word\">Safety</span>. The WBG will work to complete the Corridor X highway and to put in place an effective system of managing and maintaining other major national <span id = \"word\">Road</span>s. This engagement builds on a long standing dialogue the WBG has had in the transport sector. As regards Corridor X, many sections of the Corridor X motorways south of Belgrade are under construction and are expected to be completed in the next few years with the exception of a 6 km section that was to be funded by the Hellenic Fund. Other than this section, resources have been committed by the Government of Serbia and international financial institutions (IFIs) for the completion of the motorways. This engagement will be complemented by IFC advisory support on PPPs and infrastructure concessions, in <span id = \"word\">Road</span>s, airports and other facilities. In addition to <span id = \"word\">Road</span> and rail connectivity, the WBG will also support Serbias further integration in European energy networks. This will enhance efficiency and reduce cost, and through this helps enhancing EPS financial sustainability and mitigating climate change impact. In addition to an IBRD lending engagement on energy sector governance, IFC will consider support to energy sector diversification to b<span id = \"word\">Road</span>en Serbias energy mix. .
