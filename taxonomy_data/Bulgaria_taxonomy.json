Bulgaria\\x92s demographic decline and <span id = \"word\">Aging</span> of the population as well as internal and external migration have brought a significant and sustained shift in the population\\x92s demand for social services. This was exacerbated by the 2008 crisis, which represented a major setback to the gains in poverty reduction and inclusion. The situation in rural areas, where nearly two-thirds of the poor live, and among the Roma is of particular concern. Essential services in education, health, water and basic infrastructure and social protection are under strain and need to modernize and adjust to changing needs. Education quality remains poor in many schools across Bulgaria, especially small rural schools, and shrinking cohorts of children have triggered a significant rationalization of the school network in recent years. Access to preschool is not yet universal but with IBRD support Bulgaria has invested in expanding access to preschool and early childhood services targeted at disadvantaged children, including Roma. Bulgaria\\x92s health system continues to rely excessively on expensive hospital-based care which is ill-suited to respond to the growing importance of non-communicable diseases which could be more effectively and efficiently addressed through more prevention and primary and out-patient care.

Furthermore returns to skilled <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> have been increasing while those for unskilled <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> have been stagnant reflecting a strong relationship between lack of skills and poverty. This calls for education policies that could improve participation and raise the quality of teaching and learning at all levels of formal and non-formal education. Bulgarias youth today face significant skills deficits, especially those from disadvantaged background. For example, more than 40 percent of Bulgarian students scored below Level 2 in PISA 2012 (reflecting functional innumeracy). Weak cognitive foundation skills risk undermining students ability to acquire further skills and hampers their transition to the <span id = \"word\">Labor</span> market. A 2013 survey of employers in Bulgaria indicated that Bulgarian employers place an even higher value on foundational socio-emotional skills than other countries in the region and above the global average12. The objective is therefore to improve quality and inclusiveness of education in Bulgaria to enhance cognitive, socio-emotional and technical skills of Bulgarian youth, in particular by focusing on equipping disadvantaged students, including Roma, with the right opportunities from early childhood through formal education. Initiatives to address educational outcomes can focus on one or more of three areas: (i) addressing family and socio-economic drivers of exclusion and low participation in education, (ii) addressing structural issues in the education system itself that lead to sub-optimal outcomes, and (iii) identifying and addressing school specific factors that contribute to underperformance at the individual school level. The IBRD has previously undertaken considerable analysis of the structural issues in the education system. As a next step, the IBRD will provide analytical and advisory services to the Ministry of Education and Science on the performance of individual schools by developing a system of School Performance Indicators (SPI) to measure multiple aspects of school performance in Bulgaria13, as well as a comprehensive system of measuring school value added14, which can serve the basis for a program of support to poorly performing schools. Complementary to these efforts, the WBG will also continue examining socio-economic and other demand-side factors to understand better how excluded populations, including Roma, can realize greater levels of participation in education. It will also invest in learning lessons from the experience of the recently closed Social Inclusion Project to inform early childhood development, education and training policy. \n\n.

Mitigating environmental risks has been identified as a top Government priority, but requires significant investments to ensure that Bulgaria exploits its natural resources in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, it is imperative to improve the capacity of relevant institutions so that natural resources are better managed. While Bulgaria is compliant with EU environment acquis, the implementation of some key directives is still lagging (i.e. Water Framework Directive, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, National Emission Ceiling Directive, etc.) The main challenge lies in sectors, such as water <span id = \"word\">and</span> air quality, which are under-resourced, as well in the water sector where the Government currently faces significant challenges in responding to policy conditions (ex-ante conditionality) recently introduced by the EC in association with EU funds allocation.

Bulgarias demographic decline and aging of the population as well as internal and external migration have brought a significant and sustained shift in the populations demand for social services. This was exacerbated by the 2008 crisis, which represented a major setback to the gains in poverty reduction and inclusion. The situation in rural areas, where nearly two-thirds of the poor live, and among the Roma is of particular concern. Essential services in education, health, water and basic infrastructure and social protection are under strain and need to modernize and adjust to changing needs. Education quality remains poor in many schools across Bulgaria, especially small rural schools, and shrinking cohorts of children have triggered a significant rationalization of the school network in recent years. Access to preschool is not yet universal but with IBRD support Bulgaria has invested in expanding access to preschool and early childhood services targeted at disadvantaged children, including Roma. Bulgarias health system continues to rely excessively on expensive hospital-based care which is ill-suited to respond to the growing importance of non-communicable diseases which could be more effectively and efficiently addressed through more prevention and primary and out-patient care. The needs for long-term care of Bulgarias elderly population are increasing, but capacity to deliver such care services, especially in the community, is lacking. The bottom 40 percent has the highest average elderly dependency ratio among regional comparators because of aging and continuing heavy reliance on the family support systemwith both elderly taking care of grandchildren and <span id = \"word\">Working</span>-age members taking care of parents. While coverage of the population of water and electricity is almost complete, a sizeable part of the population is energy poor. Reliability of bulk water supply remains an issue, and policies to increase cost recovery of all water uses needs to be balanced with affordability concerns. The objective is to invest in ensuring and increasing access to essential services through modernizing the design and delivery of education, health, social protection and affordable water and basic infrastructure services. The next steps focus on the water and energy sector and include work carried by the Government and the IBRD to preserve affordability of water and energy services through RAS, and to improve the condition of many families belonging to the bottom 40 percent through the Residential Energy Efficiency Program. Moreover, with the use of own resources the IBRD will continue to engage in analytical and advisory work on improving access to social services in ECD, education, health and social protection.

Initiatives to address educational outcomes can focus on one or more of three areas: (i) addressing family and socio-economic drivers of exclusion and low participation in education, (ii) addressing structural issues in the education system itself that lead to sub-optimal outcomes, and (iii) identifying and addressing school specific factors that contribute to underperformance at the individual school level. The IBRD has previously undertaken considerable analysis of the structural issues in the education system. As a next step, the IBRD will provide analytical and advisory services to the Ministry of Education and Science on the performance of individual schools by developing a system of School Performance Indicators (SPI) to measure multiple aspects of school performance in Bulgaria13, as well as a comprehensive system of measuring school value added14, which can serve the basis for a program of support to poorly performing schools. Complementary to these efforts, the WBG will also continue examining socio-economic and other demand-side factors to understand better how excluded populations, including Roma, can realize greater levels of participation in education. It will also invest in learning lessons from the experience of the recently closed Social Inclusion Project to inform early childhood development, education and training policy. \\n\\n.

Bulgaria\\x92s demographic decline and aging of the population as well as internal and external migration have brought a significant and sustained shift in the population\\x92s demand for social services. This was exacerbated by the 2008 crisis, which represented a major setback to the gains in poverty reduction and inclusion. The situation in rural areas, where nearly two-thirds of the poor live, and among the Roma is of particular concern. Essential services in education, health, water and basic infrastructure and social protection are under strain and need to modernize and adjust to changing needs. Education quality remains poor in many schools across Bulgaria, especially small rural schools, and shrinking cohorts of children have triggered a significant rationalization of the school network in recent years. Access to preschool is not yet universal but with IBRD support Bulgaria has invested in expanding access to preschool and early childhood services targeted at disadvantaged children, including Roma. Bulgaria\\x92s health system continues to rely excessively on expensive hospital-based care which is ill-suited to respond to the growing importance of non-communicable diseases which could be more effectively and efficiently addressed through more prevention and primary and out-patient care. The needs for long-term care of Bulgaria\\x92s elderly population are increasing, but capacity to deliver such care services, especially in the community, is lacking. The bottom 40 percent has the highest average elderly dependency ratio among regional comparators because of aging and continuing heavy reliance on the family support system\\x97with both elderly taking care of grandchildren and working-age members taking care of parents. While coverage of the population of water and electricity is almost complete, a sizeable part of the population is \\x91energy poor\\x92. Reliability of bulk water supply remains an issue, and policies to increase cost recovery of all water uses needs to be balanced with affordability concerns. The objective is to invest in ensuring and increasing access to essential services through modernizing the design and delivery of education, health, social protection and affordable water and basic infrastructure services. The next steps focus on the water and energy sector and include work carried by the Government and the IBRD to preserve affordability of water and energy services through RAS, and to improve the condition of many families belonging to the bottom 40 percent through the Residential Energy Efficiency Program. Moreover, with the use of own resources the IBRD will continue to engage in analytical and advisory work on improving access to social services in ECD, education, health and social protection.

Mitigating environmental risks has been identified as a top Government priority, but requires significant investments to ensure that Bulgaria exploits its natural resources in a sustainable manner. To achieve this, it is imperative to improve the capacity of relevant institutions so that natural resources are better managed. While Bulgaria is compliant with EU environment acquis, the implementation of some key directives is still lagging (i.e. <span id = \"word\">Water</span> Framework Directive, Urban Waste <span id = \"word\">Water</span> Treatment Directive, National Emission Ceiling Directive, etc.) The main challenge lies in sectors, such as <span id = \"word\">Water</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> air quality, which are under-resourced, as well in the <span id = \"word\">Water</span> sector where the Government currently faces significant challenges in responding to policy conditions (ex-ante conditionality) recently introduced by the EC in association with EU funds allocation. In response, the Government has identified the WBG as the most reliable partner to support them in building analytical <span id = \"word\">and</span> implementation capacity to improve compliance with the EU targets (as Bulgaria has also committed to the EU 2030 GHG reductions targets).  \\n \\nThis objective is also linked to improving resilience to climate change <span id = \"word\">and</span> natural disasters.

To achieve this, it is imperative to improve the capacity of relevant institutions so that natural resources are better managed. While Bulgaria is compliant with EU environment acquis, the implementation of some key directives is still lagging (i.e. <span id = \"word\">Water</span> Framework Directive, Urban Waste <span id = \"word\">Water</span> <span id = \"word\">Treatment</span> Directive, National Emission Ceiling Directive, etc.) The main challenge lies in sectors, such as <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and air quality, which are under-resourced, as well in the <span id = \"word\">Water</span> sector where the Government currently faces significant challenges in responding to policy conditions (ex-ante conditionality) recently introduced by the EC in association with EU funds allocation. In response, the Government has identified the WBG as the most reliable partner to support them in building analytical and implementation capacity to improve compliance with the EU targets (as Bulgaria has also committed to the EU 2030 GHG reductions targets).  \\n \\nThis objective is also linked to improving resilience to climate change and natural disasters. Climate-related risks and related economic losses are expected to worsen in the next few decades and agriculture, forestry, and <span id = \"word\">Water</span> resource management will be among the sectors most deeply affected. Thus, the Government has requested WBG support in building adaptation scenarios and formulating specific adaptation measures for responding to the growing risks from climate change impacts.  \\n \\nNext steps include the finalization of the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP) to increase secure <span id = \"word\">Water</span> supply, to complete the implementation of the <span id = \"word\">Water</span> supply and sanitation reform to better comply with the <span id = \"word\">Water</span> Framework Directive, develop a methodology for a forestry inventory and pilot it in a region with the aim of conservation and more efficient management of the forests, assist the Government in building a national program for improved air quality management, and to support the Government in building adaptation scenarios and formulating specific adaptation measures. .

Bulgaria\\x92s demographic decline and aging of the population as well as internal and external migration have brought a significant and sustained shift in the population\\x92s demand for social services. This was exacerbated by the 2008 crisis, which represented a major setback to the gains in poverty reduction and inclusion. The situation in rural areas, where nearly two-thirds of the poor live, and among the Roma is of particular concern. Essential services in education, health, <span id = \"word\">Water</span> and basic infrastructure and social protection are under strain and need to modernize and adjust to changing needs. Education quality remains poor in many schools across Bulgaria, especially small rural schools, and shrinking cohorts of children have triggered a significant rationalization of the school network in recent years. Access to preschool is not yet universal but with IBRD support Bulgaria has invested in expanding access to preschool and early childhood services targeted at disadvantaged children, including Roma. Bulgaria\\x92s health system continues to rely excessively on expensive hospital-based care which is ill-suited to respond to the growing importance of non-communicable diseases which could be more effectively and efficiently addressed through more prevention and primary and out-patient care. The needs for long-term care of Bulgaria\\x92s elderly population are increasing, but capacity to deliver such care services, especially in the community, is lacking.
