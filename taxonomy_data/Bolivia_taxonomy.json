Despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in access to basic services, rural areas tend to have about half the coverage than urban areas. The gap between urban and rural areas has grown, leaving behind some of the isolated communities where <span id = \"word\">Indigenous</span> people live. The provision of quality services in rural areas faces some logistics challenges that require innovative responses. This CPF supports the Governments efforts to provide access to electricity, through the extension of the grid and the use of photovoltaic systems, and to basic infrastructure and services, through a CDD scheme, for the most disadvantaged rural communities located in some of the poorest municipalities of Bolivia. On the other side, urban areas have been growing rapidly and services have not kept pace to meet the demand. Neighborhoods, especially those located on the hillsides, require upgrading of access ways and social services.
