Similarly, deforestation, land use change, and poor soil management are resulting in soil erosion and rainfall run-off, affecting critical ecosystems in the country. Moreover, deforestation, particularly in key watersheds, has led to the loss of critical protection of water quality, fuel and non-timber forest products for local and indigenous communities, and soil stabilization to prevent excessive sedimentation and reduce run-off of agricultural nutrients. In addition to precipitation variability, changes in land use and poor soil management in the northern districts are contributing to flooding and episodes of water logging, resulting in reduced resilience of agricultural production, thus affecting <span id = \"word\">Livelihoods</span> that depend on natural resources.. 1.3 Increase in the number of people adopting sustainable natural resources management practices\nBaseline: 3,277 (2017)\nTarget: 28,000* (2022)\n*Based on total number of people provided with capacity-building support to improve management of natural resources (7,000 households) multiplied by the average number of people per household (4.1 based on 2010 census).\nSource: Project Implementation Supervision Reports (ISRs)"
