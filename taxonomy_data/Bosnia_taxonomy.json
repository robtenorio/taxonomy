Sate-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) represent a significant source of <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> and social risk. SOE arrears, including on pension contributions, is an obstacle to their privatization and restructuring.  The authorities have a broad plan to untangle the issue of SOEs by identifying enterprises that will be restructured and kept, those that will be restructured and sold, and those that will be liquidated. The WBG will start its engagement in this crucial area by building up its knowledge base through analysis. As agreement is reached on options for SOE reform, WBG could consider supporting this work through lending. The issue of pension contributions in SOEs will be addressed through a broader pension reform within the BiH <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> Resources for Growth DPL. In addition WBG team could provide advice and training on corporate governance to enhance SOE competiveness and efficiency..

Employers in BiH have cited labor legislation as one of the biggest constraints to hiring. Indeed, the country has the most rigid labor market rules in the region, and is rated as most difficult in hiring, most difficult in firing, and has the highest minimum wage among its regional peers. The government has already embarked on the labor law reform, with the new legislature recently passed in FBiH and under discussion in RS. In order to successfully implement labor market reforms, the authorities will also have to ensure an adequate and efficient safety net including social assistance and active labor market measures. At the moment, the social assistance system (including unemployment and other cash benefits) provides benefits to a small proportion of the poor and does not provide incentives to work. Public Employment Services need to become more efficient and responsive to changing labor market conditions.  WBG will support these ongoing government efforts through policy lending (Fiscal Resources for Growth DPL series) as well as though financial and advisory support to the employment program.  Technical assistance for social protection and pension system improvement will continue, with possible lending support as necessary.  .

Baseline: 40 percent Target: 65 percent\", \n\"PREVENT THE DEGRADATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES . The gradual degradation of water, air, forests, and agricultural land is a serious risk to sustainable economic growth and increases the risk of catastrophic shocks triggered by natural events. Large amounts of solid and liquid waste pollute BiH\\x92s waterways and countryside, posing <span id = \"word\">Health</span> risks through contamination of drinking water and agriculture, particularly during floods.  Improperly disposed solid waste that remains uncollected clogs urban drains, contributing to aggravate urban floods.  Although deforestation is not a widespread problem, land erosion in some deforested areas around rivers and in flood plains has exacerbated the flood damage. WBG will continue supporting responsible management of natural resources through the ongoing portfolio of investments, and will fill some of the knowledge gaps in this area through proposed analytical and advisory work on environmental hot spots and support for solid waste strategy development. .

The effort will be focused on consolidating public finances. Public <span id = \"word\">Expenditure</span>s are dominated by current expenses and social transfers. Since 2007 fiscal deficits have been financed mostly by international financial institutions, as access to capital markets is limited. The <span id = \"word\">Government</span> is working on a consolidated debt strategy. The World Bank has assisted the authorities in creating respective debt strategies, but significant operative constraints remain. Work is also underway to integrate public investment management with the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and sector strategies. Substantial arrears exist at every administrative level, and the <span id = \"word\">Government</span> needs better data on their size as well as a plan for their clearance and the prevention of subsequent re-accumulation. In order to preserve macro-fiscal stability, it is essential that the financial safety net is further strengthened.  The World Bank Group will support the authorities in their efforts to reduce budget deficits, improve public debt policy and clear arrears. Measures for achieving this are outlined in the BIH Fiscal Resources for Growth DPL, as well as planned technical assistance on pension reform and debt management. The Strengthening Financial Management and Control Project will support this objective by improving internal audit and financial control in the public sector. .

Sate-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) represent a significant source of fiscal and social risk. SOE arrears, including on pension contributions, is an obstacle to their privatization and restructuring.  The authorities have a broad plan to untangle the issue of SOEs by identifying enterprises that will be restructured and kept, those that will be restructured and sold, and those that will be liquidated. The WBG will start its engagement in this crucial area by building up its knowledge base through analysis. As agreement is reached on options for SOE reform, WBG could consider supporting this work through lending. The issue of pension contributions in SOEs will be addressed through a broader pension reform within the BiH Fiscal Resources for Growth DPL. In addition WBG team could provide advice and training on corporate governance to enhance SOE competiveness and efficiency..

The <span id = \"word\">Government</span> has already embarked on the labor law reform, with the new legislature recently passed in FBiH and under discussion in RS. In order to successfully implement labor market reforms, the authorities will also have to ensure an adequate and efficient safety net including social assistance and active labor market measures. At the moment, the social assistance system (including unemployment and other cash benefits) provides benefits to a small proportion of the poor and does not provide incentives to work. Public Employment Services need to become more efficient and responsive to changing labor market conditions.  WBG will support these ongoing <span id = \"word\">Government</span> efforts through policy lending (Fiscal Resources for Growth DPL series) as well as though financial and advisory support to the employment program.

Efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> effective management of public resources is a key priority for the authorities. The effort will be focused on consolidating public finances. Public expenditures are dominated by current expenses <span id = \"word\">and</span> social transfers. Since 2007 fiscal deficits have been financed mostly by international financial <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span>, as access to capital markets is limited. The government is working on a consolidated debt strategy. The World Bank has assisted the authorities in creating respective debt strategies, but significant operative constraints remain. Work is also underway to integrate public investment management with the medium-term macroeconomic outlook <span id = \"word\">and</span> sector strategies. Substantial arrears exist at every administrative level, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the government needs better data on their size as well as a plan for their clearance <span id = \"word\">and</span> the prevention of subsequent re-accumulation. In order to preserve macro-fiscal stability, it is essential that the financial safety net is further strengthened.  The World Bank Group will support the authorities in their efforts to reduce budget deficits, improve public debt policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> clear arrears. Measures for achieving this are outlined in the BIH Fiscal Resources for <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> DPL, as well as planned technical assistance on pension reform <span id = \"word\">and</span> debt management.

In order to stimulate foreign and domestic investment, the government is planning reforms to create better conditions for businesses to thrive, including in areas such as business licensing, inspections, access to finance, quality infrastructure and standards trading across borders,  improving corporate insolvency process, paying taxes, registering real properties.  These are reflected in the recently adopted Reform Agenda.
