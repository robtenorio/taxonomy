To increase the effectiveness of education provision, the Bank will support the Ministry of Education in the implementation of the reform of secondary education through a P4R operation, which inter alia is expected to result in a lower drop-out rate in the first year of public secondary schools reduced (Objective Indicator 7). In addition, through ongoing investment operations the Bank will continue to support selected subnational governments in the introduction of new methods of public sector management to improve education outcomes which are expected to improve average learning scores for math and Portuguese (Objective Indicator 8). For instance, the Bank is supporting several state and municipal governments in the introduction of results-based management approaches, Stallings classroom observation, bonus pay program at school level, certification and meritocratic selection of school leaders, school based management, and principal leadership training, financial incentive program for secondary school students, and accelerated learning programs.

Adopting more cost effective approaches to improving the quality of services is considerably more challenging, especially given that most policy interventions in education are implemented at the municipal and state levels. The federal government is committed to improving the design of its funding mechanisms by adopting results-based approaches, but ultimately it will have to persuade state and municipal governments to champion the policy reforms. These efforts may be hindered by the approaching election season if the results-based approach to funding is jettisoned in exchange for political support at the state and municipal levels. In addition to the risk that the policy shift towards greater efficiency does not occur implementation of the existing, access oriented portfolio could also continue to suffer from implementation difficulties, due to sequestration of budget funds and lack of political continuity in the light of upcoming elections..

The Bank is supporting the achievement of Brazils NDC and the implementation of its related targets in all sectors covered by the NDC through ongoing analytical work, and through strengthening Brazils national system of protected areas to increase the areas of environmental significance under protection measures and to support the design and adoption of sector specific NDC implementation plans (through the Amazon Regional Protected Areas Program and a new regional initiative, the Amazon Regional Landscapes Project, for reducing emissions from deforestation and land degradation (REDD+) (Objective Indicator 18; Objective Indicator 20), also contributing to lower GHG emissions (Supplementary Indicator 18.1).\nThe WBG will continue to support management of natural resources in a sustainable way, combining conservation with the promotion of local and regional economic development, as well as to work with the federal and state governments to sustain the low carbon emissions trajectory in agriculture and land use to which Brazil has committed under its NDC targets by supporting farm holdings in the adoption of landscape management and/or sustainable agricultural practices (Objective Indicator 19).\nThe WBG will seek new models to support investment in infrastructure to mitigate climate change. This will include analytical work and policy dialogue with energy sector authorities focusing on the ongoing energy sector reform. The engagement encompasses climate change energy policies, to promote the integration of distributed generation of renewable energy and energy conservation, investments in energy efficiency of industrial facilities and municipal services and the leveraging of global climate funds to mobilize <span id = \"word\">Commercial</span> financing and catalyze investments at scale. In addition, the Bank will support the Ministry of Finance in developing economic instruments to reduce emissions in the energy, industry and agro-industrial sector, specifically by contributing to the design of carbon pricing instruments. IFC will make direct investments in the renewable energy sector, seeking to further diversify Brazils energy matrix, while upholding international best practices in social and environmental standards.\nRisks to achieving this objective include (i) lower priority to NDC commitments in a time of low growth and fiscal consolidation, (ii) slow implementation of policy changes because of weak institutional capacity, (iii) and delays in project implementation due to weak implementation capacity at the subnational level. The WBG will need to stand ready to step up advocacy activities in support of the implementation of Brazils NDCs and seek to join forces with other stakeholders and development partners to help mitigate these risks..

The WBG will support the government to adopt the key policy reforms required to reestablish macro-fiscal stability and strengthen fiscal management at all levels of government. The Bank will work with the federal government to achieve implementation of the expenditure rule as a means to achieve fiscal adjustment and restore fiscal sustainability at the federal level, through a reduction in federal government primary expenditures in real terms (Objective Indicator 1). To achieve this indicator the Bank will support the federal government to rationalize public expenditures and to strengthen fiscal management, including through the programmatic Brazil Expenditure Review (P158800) and Strengthening Governance in Infrastructure (P156825), and will also support the government to restore the financial sustainability of the social security system (under Objective 1.2).The Bank will also seek to support tax reform efforts that simplify the system and seek to make it more progressive. The Bank will seek to ensure that the fiscal adjustment takes place in an efficient and equitable manner, advocating for a reduction in the ratio of firm subsidies to social transfers as percentage of GDP (Objective Indicator 2) mainly by producing analytical work and advocating for a quality fiscal consolidation (Supplementary Indicator 2.1), and building on the ongoing programmatic Brazil Expenditure Review and related ASA tasks.

To increase the effectiveness of education provision, the Bank will support the Ministry of Education in the implementation of the reform of secondary education through a P4R operation, which inter alia is expected to result in a lower drop-out rate in the first year of public secondary schools reduced (Objective Indicator 7). In addition, through ongoing investment operations the Bank will continue to support selected subnational governments in the introduction of new methods of public sector management to improve education outcomes which are expected to improve average learning scores for math and Portuguese (Objective Indicator 8). For instance, the Bank is supporting several state and municipal governments in the introduction of results-based management approaches, Stallings classroom observation, bonus pay program at school level, certification and meritocratic selection of school leaders, school based management, and principal leadership training, financial incentive program for secondary school students, and accelerated learning programs.

In parallel, IFC will support the private provision of education services, specifically by supporting <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> that expand access to quality tertiary education with the goal of increasing skills and employment among middle and lower-middle class segments of society (Objective Indicator 9).\nThere are significant risks that this objective will not be achieved. Adopting more cost effective approaches to improving the quality of services is considerably more challenging, especially given that most policy interventions in education are implemented at the municipal and state levels. The federal government is committed to improving the design of its funding mechanisms by adopting results-based approaches, but ultimately it will have to persuade state and municipal governments to champion the policy reforms. These efforts may be hindered by the approaching election season if the results-based approach to funding is jettisoned in exchange for political support at the state and municipal levels. In addition to the risk that the policy shift towards greater efficiency does not occur implementation of the existing, access oriented portfolio could also continue to suffer from implementation difficulties, due to sequestration of budget funds and lack of political continuity in the light of upcoming elections..

The main risk is that a change in government may reduce ownership for the envisaged reforms. The government is currently pushing for these reforms and has asked for Bank support. However, the removal of subsidies and distortions in access to credit is likely to generate substantial resistance from interest groups, and political support may decrease especially in the run up to the 2018 elections. The use of advocacy and ASA to forge greater consensus is one way to mitigate this risk. If these risks materialize, however, and this objective is not on track at the mid-term review in 2019, the WBG will scale down its ambition in this area.
