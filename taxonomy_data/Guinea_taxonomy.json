Limited fiscal space, and a regressive and distortionary\ntaxation system mean that there is limited room for the Government to mitigate shocks, whether they\nare from the local economy or from natural events. The governments limited presence in rural areas\nmeans that these areas are particularly vulnerable to shocks. As such, the country lacks social security\nand social assistance programs to protect against these income shocks, to help smooth consumption\nover the life cycle, reduce poverty, and promote greater human development. The Governments Terra\nRanka plan has a policy area focused on large?scale reduction of poverty, through the creation of a\nsafety net and real empowerment opportunities for the most vulnerable. The WBG proposes to support\nthis objective through a social protection program, for which an IDA operation is planned in FY18.\nAdditionally, it will support the development of a social protection strategy.
