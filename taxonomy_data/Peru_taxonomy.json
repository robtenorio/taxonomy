"para": "Ease barriers to formalization.. At about 70 percent for labor outside of agriculture, and half of all firms, <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity in Peru is among the highest in the LAC region, far above that of Mexico (60 percent) and Colombia (54 percent). Furthermore, about 13 percent of the countrys GDP originates in the <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> <span id = \"word\">Sector</span>, with limited access to credit from the formal financial system. This affects productivity significantly: productivity of <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> enterprises is about one third of that of formal enterprises. The lack of formal financial services for <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> workers and firms has important gender dimensions; in Peru only 22 percent of women report owning a deposit or transaction account -- one of the largest gender gaps worldwide. Since both workers and firms are <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>, they have problems accessing, besides finance, technology, and skills, which reinforces their <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity trap. The Government has outlined an ambitious program to eliminate barriers for the formalization of production, employment, property and credit, and has already advanced in various directions.\nThrough knowledge activities, the WB will assist with the further development of the Governments overall formalization strategy and will provide quick support to the Expert Commission on Social Protection. The WB will also support the development of the cadaster system. The IFC engagement on the reduction of barriers to business licenses and the WB engagement on taxation for small business are relevant instruments to support the formalization agenda. IFC engagement in providing financial services to micro and SMEs helps ensure that access to financial services becomes an incentive and potential stepping-stone towards formality. As the formalization strategy sharpens, the support agenda may expand, potentially including an investment operation in support of property taxation..

"para": "Enhance the environment for sustainable private sector investments.. At 20 percent of GDP over the 2010-15 period, private investment in Peru has been high by regional standards, but fell to 18 percent of GDP in 2016. Nonetheless, the sustainability of high private investments cannot be taken for granted. Private investment in infrastructure is to level off for various reasons, such as lack of a pipeline, an underdeveloped capital market and the ongoing fiscal consolidation process including management of fiscal contingencies. These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict. The last two reasons have led to long execution timelines or even complete halt of several projects.\nGiven the importance of investment for growth and employment generation, the WBG will help Peru to further improve the conditions for sustainably increasing private sector investment. The focus will be mainly in non-extractive sectors, where IFC will continue to engage with potential investors in the agribusiness and tourism sectors, and the WB will support interventions to help small farmers and boost rural development. For infrastructure, the WBG will work in a closely coordinated manner to strengthen the institutional framework to distribute risks and returns so that new investment does not impose excessive fiscal pressures, and to support the development of the domestic capital markets to lengthen maturities and reduce costs and to expand the number of domestic and international capital market and commercial financing. As a result, the government is expected to take selective niche risks that are less manageable by the market, while letting private participants take on manageable commercial and market risks. On natural resources, IFC will continue to engage with local communities on managing the mining canon, and with companies in complying with their Corporate Social Responsibility and best social and environmental practices. The WB will seek opportunities to contribute to improve policies or institutions responsible for promoting responsible investments, including helping Peru to strengthen key elements of the international taxation framework and to enhance the impact of extractive industries in the development of the countrys regions..

Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Capital</span> in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Perus science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture.

These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict.

Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Perus science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels  and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.

Private investment in infrastructure is to level off for various reasons, such as lack of a pipeline, an underdeveloped capital market and the ongoing fiscal consolidation process including management of fiscal contingencies. These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict.

At 20 percent of GDP over the 2010-15 period, private investment in Peru has been high by regional standards, but fell to 18 percent of GDP in 2016.

Private investment in infrastructure is to level off for various reasons, such as lack of a pipeline, an underdeveloped capital market and the ongoing <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> consolidation process including management of <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> contingencies. These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict. The last two reasons have led to long execution timelines or even complete halt of several projects.\nGiven the importance of investment for growth and employment generation, the WBG will help Peru to further improve the conditions for sustainably increasing private sector investment. The focus will be mainly in non-extractive sectors, where IFC will continue to engage with potential investors in the agribusiness and tourism sectors, and the WB will support interventions to help small farmers and boost rural development.

Peru needs to reshape its health sector to improve access to and quality of care and reduce inefficiencies in the public health system. The current system is highly fragmented and there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks. Priorities have been identified in three areas. First, it is necessary to adapt health services to the new epidemiological challenges, including infrastructure, technology, and reference systems. Second, <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span> management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model and converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary and secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor.

"para": "Facilitate absorption of skills and technology especially by small and medium-sized business. Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Perus science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels  and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.

During the last decade, Peru made steady progress in increasing water and sanitation (WSS) coverage, meeting the target of the MDG goal in 2015, but still trailing behind other middle-income countries in LAC. The quality of WSS service also presents significant asymmetries between service providers across the countrys territory. Outside of Lima, average service continuity has declined and the quality of public water supplies generally does not comply with required standards. The Government has set the goal of sustainable, universal coverage of potable water and sanitation <span id = \"word\">Services</span> by 2021 in the urban areas and by 2030 in rural areas, requiring investments of close to US$2.6 billion per year.

"para": "Facilitate absorption of skills and technology especially by small and medium-sized business. Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Perus science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels  and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.
