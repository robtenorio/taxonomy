"para": "Ease barriers to formalization.. At about 70 percent for labor outside of agriculture, and half of all firms, <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity in Peru is among the highest in the LAC region, far above that of Mexico (60 percent) and Colombia (54 percent). Furthermore, about 13 percent of the countrys GDP originates in the <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> <span id = \"word\">Sector</span>, with limited access to credit from the formal financial system. This affects productivity significantly: productivity of <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> enterprises is about one third of that of formal enterprises. The lack of formal financial services for <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> workers and firms has important gender dimensions; in Peru only 22 percent of women report owning a deposit or transaction account -- one of the largest gender gaps worldwide. Since both workers and firms are <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>, they have problems accessing, besides finance, technology, and skills, which reinforces their <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity trap. The Government has outlined an ambitious program to eliminate barriers for the formalization of production, employment, property and credit, and has already advanced in various directions.\nThrough knowledge activities, the WB will assist with the further development of the Governments overall formalization strategy and will provide quick support to the Expert Commission on Social Protection. The WB will also support the development of the cadaster system. The IFC engagement on the reduction of barriers to business licenses and the WB engagement on taxation for small business are relevant instruments to support the formalization agenda. IFC engagement in providing financial services to micro and SMEs helps ensure that access to financial services becomes an incentive and potential stepping-stone towards formality. As the formalization strategy sharpens, the support agenda may expand, potentially including an investment operation in support of property taxation..

Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model and converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary and secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor. Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access and the quality of the health services.

At 20 percent of GDP over the 2010-15 period, private investment in Peru has been high by regional standards, but fell to 18 percent of GDP in 2016. Nonetheless, the sustainability of high private investments cannot be taken for granted. Private investment in infrastructure is to level off for various reasons, such as lack of a pipeline, an underdeveloped capital market and the ongoing fiscal consolidation process including management of fiscal contingencies. These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects\\x92 coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict. The last two reasons have led to long execution timelines or even complete halt of several projects.\\nGiven the importance of investment for growth and employment generation, the WBG will help Peru to further improve the conditions for sustainably increasing private sector investment. The focus will be mainly in non-extractive sectors, where IFC will continue to engage with potential investors in the agribusiness and tourism sectors, and the WB will support interventions to help small farmers and boost rural development. For infrastructure, the WBG will work in a closely coordinated manner to strengthen the institutional framework to distribute risks and returns so that new investment does not impose excessive fiscal pressures, and to support the development of the domestic capital markets to lengthen maturities and reduce costs and to expand the number of domestic and international capital market and commercial financing. As a result, the government is expected to take selective niche risks that are less manageable by the market, while letting private participants take on manageable commercial and market risks.

At 20 percent of GDP over the 2010-15 period, private investment in Peru has been high by regional standards, but fell to 18 percent of GDP in 2016. Nonetheless, the sustainability of high private investments cannot be taken for granted. Private investment in infrastructure is to level off for various reasons, such as lack of a pipeline, an underdeveloped capital market and the ongoing fiscal consolidation process including management of fiscal contingencies. These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure. In addition, private investments in mining, which accounted for one-fifth of total private investment over the 2010-15 period, could also decline due to: (i) key projects coming on-stream; (ii) the difficult global environment; (iii) the exhaustion of a large pool of unexploited fields; (iv) a complex permitting framework; and, most importantly (v) because extractive industries in Peru are affected by a significant lack of trust from communities and by outright social conflict. The last two reasons have led to long execution timelines or even complete halt of several projects.\nGiven the importance of investment for growth and employment generation, the WBG will help Peru to further improve the conditions for sustainably increasing private sector investment. The focus will be mainly in non-extractive sectors, where IFC will continue to engage with potential investors in the agribusiness and tourism sectors, and the WB will support interventions to help small farmers and boost rural development. For infrastructure, the WBG will work in a closely coordinated manner to strengthen the institutional framework to distribute risks and returns so that new investment does not impose excessive fiscal pressures, and to support the development of the domestic capital markets to lengthen maturities and reduce costs and to expand the number of domestic and international capital market and commercial financing. As a result, the government is expected to take selective niche risks that are less manageable by the market, while letting private participants take on manageable commercial and market risks.

The last two reasons have led to long execution timel<span id = \"word\">in</span>es or even complete halt of several projects.\nGiven the importance of <span id = \"word\">in</span>vestment for growth and employment generation, the WBG will help Peru to further improve the conditions for susta<span id = \"word\">in</span>ably <span id = \"word\">in</span>creas<span id = \"word\">in</span>g private sector <span id = \"word\">in</span>vestment.

Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms\\x92 ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Peru\\x92s science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels \\x96 and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.

The current system is highly fragmented <span id = \"word\">and</span> there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks. Priorities have been identified in three areas. First, it is necessary to adapt health services to the new epidemiological challenges, including <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span>, technology, <span id = \"word\">and</span> reference systems. Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system.

Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia.

Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Perus science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels  and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.

Furthermore, while the construction of a national transport corridor along the coast is well advanced, substantial gaps remain to link that corridor with the Sierra and with the 22 regional priority corridors \\x96 the latter, in turn, needs to connect to rural roads. In intermediate cities like Cuzco, the impact of urban traffic on seamless connectivity across the territory is lower than in the Lima/Callao area, but still significant. In terms of <span id = \"word\">Broadband</span> connectivity, the Government is implementing a National Fiber Optic Backbone Program, but there are important gaps in the connection between it and the district capitals.\\nThe WBG has a solid portfolio to help Peru progress towards closing the connectivity gap at key nodes across the territory (the WB in roads and urban transport; IFC in the port and airport at El Callao). As existing projects and activities are completed, the WBG would continue to support interventions that promote seamless connectivity for both transport and information..

These issues have also been exacerbated by the recent corruption scandals in Latin America and in Peru associated with private investments in infrastructure.

The current system is highly fragmented <span id = \"word\">and</span> there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks.

Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model <span id = \"word\">and</span> converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary <span id = \"word\">and</span> secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor. Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia.

The current system is highly fragmented <span id = \"word\">and</span> there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks. Priorities have been identified in three areas. First, it is necessary to adapt health services to the new epidemiological challenges, including infrastructure, technology, <span id = \"word\">and</span> reference systems. Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model <span id = \"word\">and</span> converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary <span id = \"word\">and</span> secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor. Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia.

Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia.

Priorities have been identified in three areas. First, it is necessary to adapt health services to the new epidemiological challenges, including infrastructure, technology, <span id = \"word\">and</span> reference systems. Second, <span id = \"word\">Human</span> resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model <span id = \"word\">and</span> converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary <span id = \"word\">and</span> secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor. Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia. The WBG aims to scale-up its support the health sector in all of these three new areas through a multiyear engagement, <span id = \"word\">and</span> continue to help addressing chronic malnutrition through ongoing health <span id = \"word\">and</span> social protection interventions.Redesign of the SIS financing structure for primary care <span id = \"word\">and</span> secondary treatment:\\nBaseline: Primary care: inequitable \\x93capitation\\x94 (2015)\\nHospitals: Discretionary fee-for-service, no audits.\\nTarget: Primary care: Improved capitation mechanism (2021).\\nHospitals: Transparent fee-for-service, audits (2021).\\nNutrition - Percentage of children under 36 months that have received complete CRED scheme according to their age.

At about 70 percent for labor outside of agriculture, <span id = \"word\">and</span> half of all firms, informality in Peru is among the highest in the LAC region, far above that of Mexico (60 percent) <span id = \"word\">and</span> Colombia (54 percent). Furthermore, about 13 percent of the country\\x92s GDP originates in the informal sector, with limited access to credit from the formal financial system. This affects productivity significantly: productivity of informal enterprises is about one third of that of formal enterprises. The lack of formal financial services for informal workers <span id = \"word\">and</span> firms has important gender dimensions; in Peru only 22 percent of women report owning a deposit or transaction account -- one of the largest gender gaps worldwide. Since both workers <span id = \"word\">and</span> firms are informal, they have problems accessing, besides finance, technology, <span id = \"word\">and</span> skills, which reinforces their informality trap.

Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system.

During the last decade, Peru made steady progress in increasing water <span id = \"word\">and</span> sanitation (WSS) coverage, meeting the target of the MDG goal in 2015, but still trailing behind other middle-income countries in LAC. The quality of WSS service also presents significant asymmetries between service providers across the country\\x92s territory. Outside of Lima, average service continuity has declined <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of public water supplies generally does not comply with required st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards. The Government has set the goal of sustainable, universal coverage of potable water <span id = \"word\">and</span> sanitation services by 2021 in the urban areas <span id = \"word\">and</span> by 2030 in rural areas, requiring investments of close to US$2.6 billion per year. The financial <span id = \"word\">and</span> operational status of urban utilities (PES) are of particular concern regarding not only their capacity to exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> the services, but of even maintaining it.

The current system is highly fragmented <span id = \"word\">and</span> there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks. Priorities have been identified in three areas. First, it is necessary to adapt health services to the new epidemiological challenges, including infrastructure, technology, <span id = \"word\">and</span> reference systems. Second, human resources management system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system. Finally, improvements will require reforming the health insurance model <span id = \"word\">and</span> converting the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) system into a modern, efficient health insurance provider that can address both the primary <span id = \"word\">and</span> secondary health needs of the population, particularly the poor. Reducing fragmentation will generate efficiency gains that will improve access <span id = \"word\">and</span> the quality of the health services. While this transformation is launched <span id = \"word\">and</span> implemented, the Government must continue its ongoing efforts to improve basic health care, including addressing undernourishment, stunting <span id = \"word\">and</span> anemia.

"para": "Facilitate absorption of skills and technology especially by small and medium-sized business. Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Perus system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply.

At about 70 percent for labor outside of agriculture, and half of all firms, <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity in Peru is among the highest in the LAC region, far above that of Mexico (60 percent) and Colombia (54 percent). Furthermore, about 13 percent of the countrys GDP originates in the <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> <span id = \"word\">Sector</span>, with limited access to credit from the formal financial system. This affects productivity significantly: productivity of <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> enterprises is about one third of that of formal enterprises. The lack of formal financial services for <span id = \"word\">Informal</span> workers and firms has important gender dimensions; in Peru only 22 percent of women report owning a deposit or transaction account -- one of the largest gender gaps worldwide. Since both workers and firms are <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>, they have problems accessing, besides finance, technology, and skills, which reinforces their <span id = \"word\">Informal</span>ity trap. The Government has outlined an ambitious program to eliminate barriers for the formalization of production, employment, property and credit, and has already advanced in various directions.\nThrough knowledge activities, the WB will assist with the further development of the Governments overall formalization strategy and will provide quick support to the Expert Commission on Social Protection. The WB will also support the development of the cadaster system. The IFC engagement on the reduction of barriers to business licenses and the WB engagement on taxation for small business are relevant instruments to support the formalization agenda.

Peru needs to reshape its health sector to improve access to and quality of care and reduce inefficiencies in the public health system. The current system is highly fragmented and there is concern that attention to basic health services is falling between the cracks. Priorities have been identified in three areas.

Second, <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resource</span>s <span id = \"word\">Management</span> system needs an overhaul, including moving to a merit-based system.

Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Peru\\x92s system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms\\x92 ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Peru\\x92s science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels \\x96 and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services. IFC will continue to support the skills agenda through investments in high quality tertiary education and technical and vocational training.

Informal businesses in Peru have a limited access to technology, support services (like trade facilitation) and global value chains relative to large investors who own R&D departments or who are connected to multinational firms that have them. Informal SMEs, therefore, depend the most on Peru\\x92s system of science and technology, which is very weak and has limited outreach: less than one percent of Peruvian firms, compared to 6 and 8 percent of firms that have access to science and technology systems in Brazil and Chile, respectively. Technology diffusion for sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries (both catch and farmed) is also at an incipient stage of development. Technology absorption and managerial capacity is further handicapped by scarce skills. In Peru, demand for secondary and tertiary educated workers, including vocational education graduates, continues to outpace supply. The low and heterogeneous quality of education contributes to the insufficient human capital in the workforce. Enhancing the supply of high quality graduates would raise firms\\x92 ability to adopt new technologies and management processes and hence boost their productivity. It would also help them to formalize, if the firms accessing skills are informal in the first place.\\nThe WBG has a relatively young portfolio to help strengthen Peru\\x92s science, technology, and innovation system in general and, specifically, in sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture. On skills, the existing WB portfolio in education aims at improving the quality of skills at all levels \\x96 and this portfolio is expected to be complemented in the future through lending, knowledge, convening and advisory services.
