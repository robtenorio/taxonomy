In particular, the quality of the countrys port infrastructure has been deteriorating. Inefficient container handling capacity, antiquated infrastructure, high port congestion and inability to handle post-panamax vessels seriously undermine Guatemalas economic potential, and efforts to increase its productivity and competitiveness. This underdevelopment can be mostly attributed to low public infrastructure spending, and the lack of a fully functioning framework for PPPs to attract and mobilize private sector financing. Moreover, rapid and unplanned urbanization puts further pressure on Guatemalas already strained public resources and services. Over half of the countrys population of 15 million already live in urban and more than 40 percent of Guatemalas urbanites live in slums, one of the highest percentages in the region. The CPF seeks to contribute to the Governments efforts of expanding infrastructure and designing sustainable urban planning policies to foster sustainable growth.
