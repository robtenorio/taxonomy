Addressing in the barriers to basic service provision is critical to resolving one of Guatemala\\x92s most significant developmental challenges, the persistently high rates of chronic malnutrition. The major drivers of chronic malnutrition are interlinked and include poor family planning, child feeding and early stimulation practices, food insecurity, limited access to safe water and sanitation, and insufficient and low quality health services in rural and Indigenous areas. The Government is committed to working towards greater social inclusion by promoting equal access to basic services for all Guatemalans, and increasing availability of specialized services for women like peri-natal care and post rape care. Thus the expected outcome of this objective is better access to health, nutrition, and water and sanitation services with focus on Indigenous peoples and other rural vulnerable groups, especially women and children. . 1.1 Percent of children 12 months old in the areas prioritized by the National Strategy to Reduce Chronic Malnutrition receiving the complete vaccination scheme required for their age:23 Baseline: 74 percent (2016) Target:    85 percent (2020) \\n \\n1.2 Coverage of growth monitoring and promotion for children under 24 months in priority areas:24 Baseline: 10 percent (2016) Target:    50 percent (2020)\", \n\"Expand  infrastructure\\n. An underdeveloped infrastructure is one of the main obstacles to investment and economic development in Guatemala. Guatemala\\x92s infrastructure is dilapidated. In particular, the quality of the country\\x92s port infrastructure has been deteriorating. Inefficient container handling capacity, antiquated infrastructure, high port congestion and inability to handle post-panamax vessels seriously undermine Guatemala\\x92s economic potential, and efforts to increase its productivity and competitiveness. This underdevelopment can be mostly attributed to low public infrastructure spending, and the lack of a fully functioning framework for PPPs to attract and mobilize private sector financing. Moreover, rapid and unplanned urbanization puts further pressure on Guatemala\\x92s already strained public resources and services. Over half of the country\\x92s population of 15 million already live in urban and more than 40 percent of Guatemala\\x92s urbanites live in slums, one of the highest percentages in the region.

In particular, the quality of the country\\x92s port infrastructure has been deteriorating. Inefficient container handling capacity, antiquated infrastructure, high port congestion and inability to handle post-panamax vessels seriously undermine Guatemala\\x92s economic potential, and efforts to increase its productivity and competitiveness. This underdevelopment can be mostly attributed to low public infrastructure spending, and the lack of a fully functioning framework for PPPs to attract and mobilize private sector financing.

An underdeveloped infrastructure is one of the main obstacles to investment and economic development in Guatemala. Guatemala\\x92s infrastructure is dilapidated. In particular, the quality of the country\\x92s port infrastructure has been deteriorating. Inefficient container handling capacity, antiquated infrastructure, high port congestion and inability to handle post-panamax vessels seriously undermine Guatemala\\x92s economic potential, and efforts to increase its productivity and competitiveness. This underdevelopment can be mostly attributed to low public infrastructure spending, and the lack of a fully functioning framework for PPPs to attract and mobilize private sector financing. Moreover, rapid and unplanned urbanization puts further pressure on Guatemala\\x92s already strained public resources and services. Over half of the country\\x92s population of 15 million already live in urban and more than 40 percent of Guatemala\\x92s urbanites live in slums, one of the highest percentages in the region.
