Proposed CPF interventions contributing to this objective\nare cross-cutting and will contribute to other objectives as well. Targeted interventions in this area will be prepared during the first half of this CPF cycle,\nconfirmed at the Performance and Learning Review in late 2018early 2019, and implemented in the second half of the CPF cycle..

Kosovo has the youngest population in Europe, but social tensions and emigration may reemerge if demographic pressures are not absorbed\\nby the labor market and youth is not provided with opportunities to contribute to public discourse. Nearly one-third of young Kosovars (31.4 percent) are neither\\nin education, employment or training (NEET), and youth unemployment is 57.7 percent. Increasing women\\x92s <span id = \"word\">Economic</span> opportunities calls for removing the\\nbarriers and disincentives to employment that women face, in particular, (a) improving access to assets and productive inputs (for example, finance and land); (b)\\nshifting the traditionally led social norms that limit women\\x92s opportunities and providing access to affordable and quality child and elder care; and (c) removing\\ndisincentives and barriers embedded in labor taxation and regulations. The CPF will focus on providing <span id = \"word\">Economic</span> opportunities for inactive youth and women.\\nThe CPF will focus on these issues horizontally, across the portfolio, in particular with operations in education, competitiveness and export readiness of SMEs,\\nand agriculture development. But the CPF will also aim to address multiple drivers of youth exclusion and vulnerability at the municipal level by building on the\\nsuccess of the youth entrepreneurship and business development activities under the closed Kosovo Youth Development Project, with targeted nonfinancial and\\nfinancial entrepreneurship development services, tailored to disadvantaged young people and delivered through tailored local approaches. Also, by working with\\nlocal stakeholders including community and religious leaders and local governments and by providing arenas for young people to exercise voice and agency, the\\nCPF will improve local governance and service delivery targeted at excluded young men and women.

IFC will continue providing Advisory Services on Improving Investment\nClimate to promote economywide reforms that underpin a favorable business environment, FDI attraction, and address key bottlenecks to attracting more and higher-quality FDI to the country. IDA will support product certification for export markets and strengthen the capacity of export-oriented firms, with a focus on\nSMEs, and improve efficiency and reduce cost of inspection services.\nBesides reducing lending costs and improving the overall quality of borrowing requests and supporting documentation, the diversification of financial sector\nproducts is necessary to enable better access to finance for less credited sectors of the economy (including agribusiness and MSMEs) and unserved segments of\nsociety (including youth and women). IFC will continue investing in financial institutions that focus on SME lending, with the aim of increasing their outreach\nto underserved segments of SMEs. The World Bank plans to support the deepening of financial integration through strengthening of the financial sector\nintermediation and financial sector infrastructure. Key potential activities include (a) supporting the newly established Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund and (b)\nadvancing further the payment system infrastructure through establishment of an interbank card processing center which would contribute to the reduction of the\ntransactions cost for citizens and reduction of cash payments in the system. In addition to this lending project, the World Bank also aims to support the policy\nmakers goal of channeling remittances into investments through partial credit guarantees.\nAn expanded and inclusive land registration system and a more comprehensive land management framework would support significant improvements of public\nservice delivery and contribute to providing a more solid framework for private sector-led economic development. Considerable progress has been made under\nthe RECAP, reflected in progress with Doing Business indicators, and this has laid the foundation for the next set of reforms: (a) policy and legal reforms that\nenhance land tenure security, support land market functionality, and ensure <span id = \"word\">Sustainability</span> of land administration services; (b) technical land and geospatial work\nto complement Kosovos e-governance program and meet EU accession requirements; (c) economic and financial activities to support jobs growth through\ngeospatial information and improve <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> <span id = \"word\">Sustainability</span>; and (d) capacity-building initiatives to improve decision making through the use of geospatial\ninformation for both public and private sector.\nAccelerated and equitable private sector growth will require a focus on increased connectivity.

This CPFin continuation with the last CPSaims to improve water resource management for the benefit of various water users in Central\nKosovo. The central/northern high-lying plateau that covers about half of the countrys territory holds the countrys largest development potential as most of the\nmining, agricultural, and industrial activities are located here. The region depends almost entirely on the Ibr-Lepenc canal, which is an <span id = \"word\">Aging</span> multipurpose\nwater conveyance system, supplying water for energy production, mining, industrial, agricultural, and household uses. The CPF will support rehabilitation of\nthis important waterway and contribute to (a) reduction of drinking water production costs, (b) water loss prevention because of extreme natural events, (c)\nreduction of industrial production costs, (d) increase of hydroelectricity production, and (e) irrigation benefits.\nThe CPF will also help the Government mitigate and reverse adverse environmental and social impacts from the exploitation of natural resources. The CPF\nrecognizes that environmentally sensitive use of Kosovos major natural resources, such as water, and better management of environmental hazards (air and soil\npollution, solid waste, and wastewater in particular) are critical elements of the efforts to improve the populations health and living standards and create a more\nsupportive investment environment. The CPF will consider supporting further environmental clean-up and restoration activities to reverse the impact of\nindustrial polluters. An ASA on air pollution will be included in the CPF and will assess options for investments. The CPF also aims to support Kosovo develop\nthe capacity to minimize the social impact of investments and activities exploiting the economic potential of natural resources, such as in mining..

Kosovo has the youngest population in Europe, but social tensions and emigration may reemerge if demographic pressures are not absorbed\\nby the labor market and youth is not provided with opportunities to contribute to public discourse. Nearly one-third of young Kosovars (31.4 percent) are neither\\nin education, employment or training (NEET), and youth unemployment is 57.7 percent. Increasing women\\x92s economic opportunities calls for removing the\\nbarriers and disincentives to employment that women face, in particular, (a) improving access to assets and productive inputs (for example, finance and land); (b)\\nshifting the traditionally led social norms that limit women\\x92s opportunities and providing access to affordable and quality child and elder care; and (c) removing\\ndisincentives and barriers embedded in labor taxation and regulations. The CPF will focus on providing economic opportunities for inactive youth and women.\\nThe CPF will focus on these issues horizontally, across the portfolio, in particular with operations in education, competitiveness and export readiness of SMEs,\\nand agriculture development. But the CPF will also aim to address multiple drivers of youth exclusion and vulnerability at the municipal level by building on the\\nsuccess of the youth entrepreneurship and business development activities under the closed Kosovo Youth Development Project, with targeted nonfinancial and\\nfinancial entrepreneurship development services, tailored to disadvantaged young people and delivered through tailored local approaches. Also, by working with\\nlocal stakeholders including community and religious leaders and local governments and by providing arenas for young people to exercise voice and agency, the\\nCPF will improve local governance and service delivery targeted at excluded young men and women.

A more effective legal, regulatory, and administrative framework to govern trade and investment is needed to help enhance the capacity of\\nbusinesses to withstand competitive pressures and connect with global value chains. IFC will continue providing Advisory Services on Improving Investment\\nClimate to promote economywide reforms that underpin a favorable business environment, FDI attraction, and address key bottlenecks to attracting more and higher-quality FDI to the country. IDA will support product certification for export markets and strengthen the capacity of export-oriented firms, with a focus on\\nSMEs, and improve efficiency and reduce cost of inspection services.\\nBesides reducing lending costs and improving the overall quality of borrowing requests and supporting documentation, the diversification of financial sector\\nproducts is necessary to enable better access to finance for less credited sectors of the economy (including agribusiness and MSMEs) and unserved segments of\\nsociety (including youth and women). IFC will continue investing in financial institutions that focus on SME lending, with the aim of increasing their outreach\\nto underserved segments of SMEs. The World Bank plans to support the deepening of financial integration through strengthening of the financial sector\\nintermediation and financial sector infrastructure. Key potential activities include (a) supporting the newly established Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund and (b)\\nadvancing further the payment system infrastructure through establishment of an interbank card processing center which would contribute to the reduction of the\\ntransactions cost for citizens and reduction of cash payments in the system. In addition to this lending project, the World Bank also aims to support the <span id = \"word\">Policy</span>\\nmakers\\x92 goal of channeling remittances into investments through partial credit guarantees.\\nAn expanded and inclusive land registration system and a more comprehensive land management framework would support significant improvements of public\\nservice delivery and contribute to providing a more solid framework for private sector-led economic development.
