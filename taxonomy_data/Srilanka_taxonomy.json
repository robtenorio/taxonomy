The annual average loss associated with disasters is estimated to be already in excess of US$380 million and affecting more than 1 million citizens. Water resource development and management risks are increasing sharply with climate change, and Sri Lanka\\x92s water institutions have not adapted to these challenges through the adoption of a coherent basinlevel framework.  \\n \\nWBG Interventions: WBG interventions will build on ongoing operations to improve short-term and long-term resilience to climate and disaster risk by moving toward implementing a comprehensive, evidence-based, and innovative climate resilience program that addresses further the physical and fiscal impacts of climate change and natural disaster risks. Support will also be provided for agencies to move toward basin-level integrated planning, and to ensure adoption of an integrated water resource development and management framework that respects requirements for protecting society and the environment.  \\n . 3.2.1 Number of hectares (ha) benefitted with reduced annual crop losses from weatherrelated events  Baseline: 0 ha (2016)   Target:  149,000 ha (2019) \\n \\n \\n3.2.2 Reduction in number of people at risk to weather-related transport interruptions  Baseline: 0 (2016)   Target: 1,000,000 (2019) \\n \\n \\n3.2.3 Number of government agencies using improved water database for flood forecasting, dam operations, and water allocations Baseline: 0 (2016)   Target: 25 (2019)\", \n\"Enhancing mitigation and adaption potential through renewable energy development and natural resource management .  Sri Lanka\\x92s electricity generation mix has shown a progressive shift from hydro- to fossil fuel-based technologies, with more than 50 percent of electricity generation currently relying on imported fossil fuels. This shift, together with the growth of energy-intensive manufacturing and services, amplifies the vulnerability of the Sri Lankan economy to the increasing <span id = \"word\">Price</span> <span id = \"word\">Volatility</span> of fossil fuels. Sri Lanka is also exceptionally well endowed with biodiversity and natural resources, which are important assets for future economic development and climate change mitigation and adaptation. However the value of these assets is often poorly understood, leading to their undervaluation and weak management.

Urban infrastructure and services are currently inadequate and are poorly designed and maintained to generate the capital, human resources, technology, and services needed for sustainable growth and employment generation in the future through the dynamic spatial transformation process that Sri Lanka is undergoing. Large numbers of people among the bottom 40 percent of the economy live in urban agglomeration areas, highlighting the need for efficient, inclusive, and sustainable urbanization of cities to become centers of growth and employment for those already living there and those who will migrate from rural communities, and at the same time to provide livable and resilient environments. It is also necessary to manage the environmental impacts of urbanization and economic transformation. \\n \\nWBG Interventions: WBG interventions will build on ongoing operations that improve selected urban services and <span id = \"word\">Public</span> spaces in key city regions of Sri Lanka and will help stimulate more efficient and participatory green urban planning, governance, and management of cities in line with international best practice.

Extreme variability of rainfall and droughts is already a defining feature of Sri Lanka\\x92s climate. The annual average loss associated with disasters is estimated to be already in excess of US$380 million and affecting more than 1 million citizens.

Sri Lanka\\x92s electricity generation mix has shown a progressive shift from hydro- to fossil fuel-based technologies, with more than 50 percent of electricity generation currently relying on imported fossil fuels. This shift, together with the growth of energy-intensive manufacturing and services, amplifies the vulnerability of the Sri Lankan economy to the increasing price volatility of fossil fuels. Sri Lanka is also exceptionally well endowed with biodiversity and natural resources, which are important assets for future economic development and climate change mitigation and adaptation. However the value of these assets is often poorly understood, leading to their undervaluation and weak management.  In Sri Lanka, 30 percent of dry zone forests is already degraded, and wet zone forests are characterized by highly fragmented small forest patches. Deforestation and forest degradation contribute to carbon emissions and pose a significant threat to the economic services Sri Lanka derives from its forests. \\n \\n \\nWBG Interventions: WBG interventions will support the shift away from fossil fuel-based electricity generation through planned investment support featuring innovative financing structures for development of wind and other sources of renewable energy.

Persistent pockets of poverty in the lagging regions pose a fundamental challenge of social and economic inclusion and social sustainability of the countrys development model. For war-affected internally displaced persons who have been newly resettled, restarting their livelihoods via farming in jungle-like areas has been difficult, which makes them particularly vulnerable. Communities in lagging regions are also affected by malnutrition in mothers and children. The issue is particularly acute in the estate sector.  WBG Interventions: WBG interventions will include systemic, multidimensional interventions targeted at the lagging regions to improve access to rural livelihood assets and employment opportunities, infrastructure and social services, micro-finance and other financial services, and markets. The WBG program will also focus on accompanying the GoSLs efforts toward improved provision of public services by local governments in selected areas. Other interventions will target the strengthening and monitoring of nutrition outcomes of the populations living in the estate sector and in war-affected areas. . 2.3.1 Number of people provided with access to improved water sources (in rural areas and estates), including percentage of females  Baseline: 0 (0% female) (2015)   Target:  343,900 (% female TBD) (2020) \n \n2.3.2 Number of people provided with access to improved <span id = \"word\">Sanitation</span> (in rural areas and estates), including percentage of females Baseline: 0 (0% female) (2015)   Target:  129,000 (% female TBD) (2020) \n \n2.3.3 Number of ECD centers established in unserved and underserved areas (includes rural and estate sectors) Baseline: 0 (2015)   Target:  150 (2020) \n \n \n2.3.4 Number of new jobs generated through investments in agriculture SMEs Baseline:   0 (2016)   Target:      4,000 (2020)"
