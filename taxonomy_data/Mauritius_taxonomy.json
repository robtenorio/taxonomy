Given the critical importance of the financial sector to Mauritius continued growth and development, ensuring its\ncontinued stability is essential. Recent developments in the sector have prompted a reassessment of the adequacy of the financial stability\nframework for a country with a large and open financial sector that has critical linkages to the offshore sector and the need to put in place\nstronger regulatory and supervisory arrangements as well as an effective framework to manage instances of institutional and system-wide\nstress or instability. The CPF program will aim to assist the Government in ensuring the continued resilience of the financial sector.\nPlanned TA will support the Government, the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) and the Financial Services Commission to implement the key\nrecommendations from the FSAP, especially as they relate to supervision and oversight of financial conglomerates, managing risks related to the Global Business Sector, as well as financial inclusion.
