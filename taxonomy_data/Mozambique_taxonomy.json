Despite substantial improvement in primary enrollment rates over the last decade, primary completion rates remain low. Children tend to drop out early, especially those from the most vulnerable areas, and learning achievements are considerably lower than in comparable countries.

There are also severe institutional constraints which hinder the capacity of the system to deliver results. The supply of post-basic <span id = \"word\">Education</span> remains limited, especially in key areas such as science and technology. The low quality of most post-basic trainings, including their lack of relevance to the labor market, is a key constraint to improving students employability and supporting economic growth.

The World Bank will continue to support the delivery of early childhood <span id = \"word\">Education</span>, allowing children to be better prepared for primary <span id = \"word\">Education</span>. At the basic <span id = \"word\">Education</span> level, World Bank support will focus on key interventions to strengthen the ability of the system to deliver better results in terms of learning achievements. This will include the provision of additional and improved inputs targeting areas and individuals lagging behind and addressing key weaknesses in service delivery through strengthened governance and accountability at the school level. In addition, World Bank support will focus on increasing the number and raising the quality of graduates at post-basic level as well as strengthening the research capacities. Through these interventions, World Bank support is expected to contribute to improving the skills profile of the Mozambican population; providing better opportunities to acquire basic literacy and numeracy skills; and substantially increasing the supply of technical, market-relevant skills to enhance competitiveness and accelerate economic growth. . 12.

Agriculture offers scope to narrow persistent income disparities between rural and urban areas and to reduce poverty in regions that benefitted little from the economic gains of recent years. The high potential areas for agriculture stretch across most of the northern and central regions, with good potential for high-performing crop combinations. Mozambique has gradually developed a substantial policy and strategic framework for increasing agriculture productivity but growth remains slow due to a number of constraining factors. The CPF program will contribute to unlocking the agriculture sectors potential by (a) increasing agriculture and forestry productivity by providing farmers, natural forest operators, and planation growers with access to productivity-enhancing inputs, technologies, rural credit, expanded irrigation, and access to markets and training; (b) promoting agribusiness development of large-, medium-, and small-scale commercial agriculture, agro-processing, and forestry value chains; (c) supporting better road infrastructure improving linkages between smallholders and agribusiness companies and general access to both national and regional markets for agriculture and forestry products; and (d) enhancing land tenure security. The interventions will also strengthen institutions to improve the delivery of services. 4.

Ensuring continued financial system stability is vital for continuing to promote access to financial services as well as minimizing possible <span id = \"word\">Contingent</span> fiscal <span id = \"word\">Liabilities</span> stemming from potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The countrys geographic position between Southeastern Africa and the large economies of South and Southeast Asia offers a great opportunity to develop logistical corridors and foster growth; however, high trade costs limit potential trade growth. To realize the national priority of promoting jobs and improving Mozambiques overall productivity and competitiveness, the Government is committed to strengthening private sector development as the main engine for propelling inclusive growth of incomes and employment in a sustainable way across a more diversified economic base. Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, trade facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance. In the financial sector, the program will support the adoption and implementation of reforms that can improve the enabling environment in this space.

Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy.

Despite improvements in health services coverage in the last decade, disparities across regions and between rural-urban areas remain significantly high and women and children are disproportionately at risk. A number of health indicators still lag behind neighboring countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. For example, Mozambique ranks 11 of 15 countries in the SADC in infant and child mortality. The rate of stunting at 43 percent is among the highest in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. The GoM embraced the UHC approach to progressively expand priority health and nutrition programs to vulnerable populations while ensuring sustainable financial coverage and protection, a process embodied in its ten-year Health Sector Strategic Plan (PESS) which aims to strengthen the health system to improve service delivery and the quality of care by addressing <span id = \"word\">Human</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span> for health, decentralization, governance of the sector, health technology, supply chain of medicines and other health goods while focusing particular attention on women and children.

The pace and depth of reforms remains uneven and the business environment remains costly, time-consuming, and restrictive. Access to finance is a particular concern, with majority of MSME owners financially excluded. Ensuring continued financial system stability is vital for continuing to promote access to financial services as well as minimizing possible contingent fiscal liabilities stemming from potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The countrys geographic position between Southeastern Africa and the large economies of South and Southeast Asia offers a great opportunity to develop logistical corridors and foster growth; however, high <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> costs limit potential <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> growth. To realize the national priority of promoting jobs and improving Mozambiques overall productivity and competitiveness, the Government is committed to strengthening private sector development as the main engine for propelling inclusive growth of incomes and employment in a sustainable way across a more diversified economic base. Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> openness and investor-friendly <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance. In the financial sector, the program will support the adoption and implementation of reforms that can improve the enabling environment in this space. In addition, the APEI Regional DPO will support a multilateral approach of coordinated implementation of reforms. . 7.
