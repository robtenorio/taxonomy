"para": "c(\"Improving Economic Management . In the near term, Mozambique must manage a macroeconomic crisis brought about by the discovery of undisclosed debt. Until revenues from gas production are realized, the fiscal position will be under stress and a thorough reassessment and tighter management of government expenditures will be needed. Thereafter, realization of <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> resource revenues will place significant strain on the government\\x92s capacity for macro-fiscal management. The SCD highlights the complex macroeconomic and fiscal policy challenges of effectively utilizing resource wealth. At the same time, as illustrated in the hidden debt crisis, Mozambique is exposed to fiscal risks related to its SOEs, increasing use of non-concessional financing, and more sophisticated financing instruments (for example, sovereign guarantees, international bond issuance, and PPPs). Ensuring that Mozambique is well poised to manage these complex challenges will involve adopting a sound fiscal framework to reestablish fiscal sustainability. The Government has improved its debt and fiscal risk management capacity over the past several years, but challenges remain. The World Bank and IMF are providing TA to the Government to improve its debt management capacity and support debt market development which are also supported through policy reforms. Finally, strengthening oversight over SOEs and public investment management should be prioritized to ensure that the country\\x92s investment portfolio generates social and economic returns that enhance social and economic well-being. The CPF program will use ASA and budget support financing to support the reforms needed to meet these challenges. Budget support will be backed up by TA and ASA. . 1.

Mining and gas operations subject to fiscal controls in line with the established fiscal regime in Mozambique Baseline: 0 (2015) Target: 5 (2020)\", \n\"Expand Access and Improved Reliability of Electricity . Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall development of both rural and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity development and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded. The private sector could play a substantial role in developing the potentially large energy sector projects, and the proceeds from regional energy trade could be used to finance access and system expansion at the national level. The legal and enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the development of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector. IFC investment and MIGA guarantees will support private sector-driven generation investment (grid and off-grid), contingent on implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to address issues that impede private investment in the sector. Developing institutional arrangements for improving performance of the utility and ensuring the sector is financially viable will be an important part of the program and may also be supported through DPOs. . 10.

"para": "c(\"Improving Economic Management . In the near term, Mozambique must manage a macroeconomic crisis brought about by the discovery of undisclosed debt. Until revenues from gas production are realized, the fiscal position will be under stress and a thorough reassessment and tighter management of government expenditures will be needed. Thereafter, realization of natural resource revenues will place significant strain on the government\\x92s capacity for macro-fiscal management. The SCD highlights the complex macroeconomic and fiscal policy challenges of effectively utilizing resource wealth. At the same time, as illustrated in the hidden debt crisis, Mozambique is exposed to fiscal risks related to its SOEs, increasing use of non-concessional financing, and more sophisticated financing instruments (for example, sovereign guarantees, international bond issuance, and PPPs). Ensuring that Mozambique is well poised to manage these complex challenges will involve adopting a sound fiscal framework to reestablish fiscal sustainability. The Government has improved its debt and fiscal risk management capacity over the past several years, but challenges remain. The World Bank and IMF are providing TA to the Government to improve its debt management capacity and support debt market <span id = \"word\">Development</span> which are also supported through policy reforms. Finally, strengthening oversight over SOEs and public investment management should be prioritized to ensure that the country\\x92s investment portfolio generates social and economic returns that enhance social and economic well-being. The CPF program will use ASA and budget support financing to support the reforms needed to meet these challenges. Budget support will be backed up by TA and ASA. . 1.

Mining and gas operations subject to fiscal controls in line with the established fiscal regime in Mozambique Baseline: 0 (2015) Target: 5 (2020)\", \n\"Expand Access and Improved Reliability of Electricity . Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of both <span id = \"word\">Rural</span> and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in <span id = \"word\">Rural</span> areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity <span id = \"word\">Development</span> and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded. The private sector could play a substantial role in developing the potentially large energy sector projects, and the proceeds from regional energy trade could be used to finance access and system expansion at the national level. The legal and enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector. IFC investment and MIGA guarantees will support private sector-driven generation investment (grid and off-grid), contingent on implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to address issues that impede private investment in the sector. Developing institutional arrangements for improving performance of the utility and ensuring the sector is financially viable will be an important part of the program and may also be supported through DPOs. . 10.

There is compelling empirical evidence that safe water and sanitation are among the critical determinants of human <span id = \"word\">Development</span>, with impacts on health,\\neducation, wages, and poverty levels. Half of the Mozambican population has no access to improved water supply, and the majority of people (79%) still\\nrely on unimproved sanitation or practice open defecation (39%), resulting in diarrheal diseases, cholera epidemics, and high rates of stunting. Reducing the\\ndisease burden on the economic and social <span id = \"word\">Development</span> of Mozambique requires integrated water and sanitation improvements to reduce the transmission of\\nwaterborne diseases. The CPF program features an integrated program of institutional strengthening and infrastructure <span id = \"word\">Development</span> for water resources\\nmonitoring and allocation and urban water supply and sanitation. Ongoing and planned investment finance will expand the supply of water to the Greater\\nMaputo area as well as a set of secondary and tertiary cities along strategic economic growth corridors that have experienced rapid growth due to investment\\nin natural-resource exploitation and agricultural production. By focusing on low-income peri-urban areas and subsidizing connections to the water system\\nfor low-income households, the program targets poorer and more vulnerable populations. The program will also support the implementation of a\\nstrengthened management framework in the sector to improve the performance of the utilities.. 17.

Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas.

To improve its resilience <span id = \"word\">and</span> coverage <span id = \"word\">and</span>/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished <span id = \"word\">and</span> exp<span id = \"word\">and</span>ed.

The legal <span id = \"word\">and</span> enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable <span id = \"word\">and</span> efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity <span id = \"word\">and</span> developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks.

Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas.

The legal <span id = \"word\">and</span> enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable <span id = \"word\">and</span> efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity <span id = \"word\">and</span> developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks.

Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall development of both rural and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity development and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded. The private sector could play a substantial role in developing the potentially large energy sector projects, and the proceeds from regional energy trade could be used to finance access and system expansion at the national level. The legal and enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the development of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector. IFC investment and MIGA guarantees will support private sector-driven generation investment (grid and off-grid), contingent on implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to address issues that impede private investment in the sector.

Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the development of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector.

Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall development of both rural and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity development and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded.

Mozambique\\x92s economy is highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks. The sensitivity of the Mozambique economy to these shocks is reflected in significant\\nfiscal and economic impacts of the recurrent droughts and floods. The WBG contribution to this area aims at increasing resilience to high levels of short-term\\nweather variability and longer-term climate change and by strengthening planning and disaster-risk management capacity. The WBG support will focus on\\nbuilding the national capacity for climate change adaptation and resilience, through institutional and policy development to address climate change and disaster\\nrisk reduction, enhancing adoption of climate-smart resources management practices, and integrating climate risk assessments into planning and infrastructure\\ndevelopment. Mozambique is well endowed with renewable natural resources, particularly forests and fisheries, which can generate a steady flow of benefits\\nto poor rural communities if well managed. These benefits include rural income, improved nutrition, more resilient ecosystems, and hence decreased natural\\ncatastrophes and more productive agriculture. Renewable natural resources tend to be closest to the poorest population, particularly those in remote areas;\\nhence, their sustainable management directly contributes not only to reduce poverty but also to shared prosperity. In forestry, the CPF program will promote\\nreduction of forest cover loss through traditional grant financing and innovative performance-based payments (emissions reductions payments). In wildlife\\nconservation, the program will promote sustainable use of protected areas to generate income streams through nature-based tourism, conservation agriculture,\\nand non-timber forest products value chains, among others. In fisheries, the program promotes food security and nutrition, job creation for rural coastal\\npopulations, and increased income to fishing communities. 25.

Until revenues from gas production are realized, the fiscal position will be under stress and a thorough reassessment and tighter management of government expenditures will be needed. Thereafter, realization of natural resource revenues will place significant strain on the government\\x92s capacity for macro-fiscal management. The SCD highlights the complex macroeconomic and fiscal policy challenges of effectively utilizing resource wealth. At the same time, as illustrated in the hidden debt crisis, Mozambique is exposed to fiscal risks related to its SOEs, increasing use of non-concessional financing, and more sophisticated financing instruments (for example, sovereign guarantees, international bond issuance, and PPPs). Ensuring that Mozambique is well poised to manage these complex challenges will involve adopting a sound fiscal framework to reestablish fiscal sustainability.

Despite substantial improvement in primary enrollment rates over the last decade, primary completion rates remain low. Children tend to drop out early, especially those from the most vulnerable areas, and learning achievements are considerably lower than in comparable countries. The quality of services provided is weak, due in part to substantial weaknesses in teachers\\x92 performance, including low competencies and high rates of absenteeism. There are also severe institutional constraints which hinder the capacity of the system to deliver results. The supply of post-basic education remains limited, especially in key areas such as science and technology. The low quality of most post-basic trainings, including their lack of relevance to the labor market, is a key constraint to improving students\\x92 employability and supporting economic growth. Increased education outcomes have the potential to play a critical role to ensuring inclusive growth. The Government has prioritized activities aimed at reducing disparities in access to basic education; improving learning outcomes; and strengthening the provision of relevant, quality training at post-basic level. The World Bank will continue to support the delivery of early childhood education, allowing children to be better prepared for primary education. At the basic education level, World Bank support will focus on key interventions to strengthen the ability of the system to deliver better results in terms of learning achievements. This will include the provision of additional and improved inputs targeting areas and individuals lagging behind and addressing key weaknesses in service delivery through strengthened governance and accountability at the school level. In addition, World Bank support will focus on increasing the number and raising the quality of graduates at post-basic level as well as strengthening the research capacities. Through these interventions, World Bank support is expected to contribute to improving the skills profile of the Mozambican population; providing better opportunities to acquire basic literacy and numeracy skills; and substantially increasing the supply of technical, market-relevant skills to enhance competitiveness and accelerate economic growth. . 12.

Despite improvements in health services coverage in the last decade, disparities across regions and between rural-urban areas remain significantly high and women and children are disproportionately at risk. A number of health indicators still lag behind neighboring countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. For example, Mozambique ranks 11 of 15 countries in the SADC in infant and child mortality. The rate of stunting at 43 percent is among the highest in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. The GoM embraced the UHC approach to progressively expand priority health and nutrition programs to vulnerable populations while ensuring sustainable financial coverage and protection, a process embodied in its ten-year Health Sector Strategic Plan (PESS) which aims to strengthen the health system to improve service delivery and the quality of care by addressing human resources for health, decentralization, governance of the sector, health technology, supply chain of medicines and other health goods while focusing particular attention on women and children. The CPF program will have a strong focus on investing in the early years and will seek to contribute to improving service delivery in the areas of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health while strengthening the health systems performance in particular supply chains with the overall aim of contributing to ensuring UHC in Mozambique. 14.

In addition, despite improvements, Mozambique still lacks some of the basic data and statistics required to inform economic policy, monitor progress, and adapt strategies as needed. To address issues related to data and statistics, the CPF will support the 2017 census, a comprehensive program of\\nhousehold surveys, a geo-referenced administrative data system, and TA on data collection and analysis.

The World Bank and IMF are providing TA to the Government to improve its debt management capacity and support debt market development which are also supported through policy reforms. Finally, strengthening oversight over SOEs and public investment management should be prioritized to ensure that the country\\x92s investment portfolio generates social and economic returns that enhance social and economic well-being. The CPF program will use ASA and budget support financing to support the reforms needed to meet these challenges. Budget support will be backed up by TA and ASA. . 1.

Mozambique\\x92s private sector is diverse and remains largely underdeveloped. The pace and depth of reforms remains uneven and the business environment remains costly, time-consuming, and restrictive. Access to finance is a particular concern, with majority of MSME owners financially excluded. Ensuring continued financial system stability is vital for continuing to promote access to financial services as well as minimizing possible contingent fiscal liabilities stemming from potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The country\\x92s geographic position between Southeastern Africa and the large economies of South and Southeast Asia offers a great opportunity to develop logistical corridors and foster growth; however, high trade costs limit potential trade growth. To realize the national priority of promoting jobs and improving Mozambique\\x92s overall productivity and competitiveness, the Government is committed to strengthening private sector development as the main engine for propelling inclusive growth of incomes and employment in a sustainable way across a more diversified economic base. Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, trade facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance. In the financial sector, the program will support the adoption and implementation of reforms that can improve the enabling environment in this space. In addition, the APEI Regional DPO will support a multilateral approach of coordinated implementation of reforms. . 7.

Mozambique\\x92s private sector is diverse and remains largely underdeveloped. The pace and depth of reforms remains uneven and the business environment remains costly, time-consuming, and restrictive. Access to finance is a particular concern, with majority of MSME owners financially excluded. Ensuring continued financial system stability is vital for continuing to promote access to financial services as well as minimizing possible contingent fiscal liabilities stemming from potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The country\\x92s geographic position between Southeastern Africa and the large economies of South and Southeast Asia offers a great opportunity to develop logistical corridors and foster growth; however, high trade costs limit potential trade growth. To realize the national priority of promoting jobs and improving Mozambique\\x92s overall productivity and competitiveness, the Government is committed to strengthening private sector development as the main engine for propelling inclusive growth of incomes and employment in a sustainable way across a more diversified economic base. Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, <span id = \"word\">Management</span> and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, trade facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance. In the financial sector, the program will support the adoption and implementation of reforms that can improve the enabling environment in this space. In addition, the APEI Regional DPO will support a multilateral approach of coordinated implementation of reforms. . 7.

"para": "Increasing Agriculture Growth . The agricultural sector (including livestock, fisheries, and forestry) engages three-quarters of the population and rural poverty is closely related to low agricultural productivity. Agriculture offers scope to narrow persistent income disparities between rural and urban areas and to reduce poverty in regions that benefitted little from the economic gains of recent years. The high potential areas for agriculture stretch across most of the northern and central regions, with good potential for high-performing crop combinations. Mozambique has gradually developed a substantial policy and strategic framework for increasing agriculture productivity but growth remains slow due to a number of constraining factors. The CPF program will contribute to unlocking the agriculture sectorü¾Œ£¤¼s potential by (a) increasing agriculture and forestry productivity by providing farmers, natural forest operators, and planation growers with access to productivity-enhancing inputs, technologies, rural credit, expanded irrigation, and access to <span id = \"word\">Markets</span> and training; (b) promoting agribusiness development of large-, medium-, and small-scale commercial agriculture, agro-processing, and forestry value chains; (c) supporting better road infrastructure improving linkages between smallholders and agribusiness companies and general access to both national and regional <span id = \"word\">Markets</span> for agriculture and forestry products; and (d) enhancing land tenure security.

Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall development of both rural and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity development and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded. The private sector could play a substantial role in developing the potentially large energy sector projects, and the proceeds from regional energy trade could be used to <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> access and system expansion at the national level. The legal and enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional trade through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the development of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector. IFC investment and MIGA guarantees will support private sector-driven generation investment (grid and off-grid), contingent on implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to address issues that impede private investment in the sector. Developing institutional arrangements for improving performance of the utility and ensuring the sector is financially viable will be an important part of the program and may also be supported through DPOs. . 10.

Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, trade facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance.

The high potential areas for agriculture stretch across most of the northern and central regions, with good potential for high-performing crop combinations. Mozambique has gradually developed a substantial policy and strategic framework for increasing agriculture productivity but growth remains slow due to a number of constraining factors. The CPF program will contribute to unlocking the agriculture sector\\x92s potential by (a) increasing agriculture and forestry productivity by providing farmers, natural forest operators, and planation growers with access to productivity-enhancing inputs, technologies, rural credit, expanded irrigation, and access to markets and training; (b) promoting agribusiness development of large-, medium-, and small-scale commercial agriculture, agro-processing, and forestry value chains; (c) supporting better road infrastructure improving linkages between smallholders and agribusiness companies and general access to both national and regional markets for agriculture and forestry products; and (d) enhancing land tenure security.

To achieve a sustainable reduction in <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span>, productive inclusion\\nactivities (activation programs, skills transfers, savings, financial literacy, micro-credits, and so on) and human development interventions (nutrition) will\\ncomplement cash transfer schemes under the productive safety nets. Due to the specific challenges in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings, the rapid <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization process and the\\npotential impact of a possible fuel subsidy reform, the World Bank will support the design and implementation of specific safety nets and productive inclusion\\ninterventions in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings.

Thereafter, realization of natural resource revenues will place significant strain on the government\\x92s capacity for macro-fiscal management. The SCD highlights the complex macroeconomic <span id = \"word\">and</span> fiscal policy challenges of effectively utilizing resource wealth. At the same time, as illustrated in the hidden debt crisis, Mozambique is exposed to fiscal risks related to its SOEs, increasing use of non-concessional financing, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more sophisticated financing instruments (for example, sovereign guarantees, international bond issuance, <span id = \"word\">and</span> PPPs). Ensuring that Mozambique is well poised to manage these complex challenges will involve adopting a sound fiscal framework to reestablish fiscal sustainability.

Until revenues from gas production are realized, the fiscal position will be under stress <span id = \"word\">and</span> a thorough reassessment <span id = \"word\">and</span> tighter management of government expenditures will be needed. Thereafter, realization of natural resource revenues will place significant strain on the government\\x92s capacity for macro-fiscal management. The SCD highlights the complex macroeconomic <span id = \"word\">and</span> fiscal policy challenges of effectively utilizing resource wealth. At the same time, as illustrated in the hidden debt crisis, Mozambique is exposed to fiscal risks related to its SOEs, increasing use of non-concessional financing, <span id = \"word\">and</span> more sophisticated financing instruments (for example, sovereign guarantees, international bond issuance, <span id = \"word\">and</span> PPPs). Ensuring that Mozambique is well poised to manage these complex challenges will involve adopting a sound fiscal framework to reestablish fiscal sustainability. The Government has improved its debt <span id = \"word\">and</span> fiscal risk management capacity over the past several years, but challenges remain. The World Bank <span id = \"word\">and</span> IMF are providing TA to the Government to improve its debt management capacity <span id = \"word\">and</span> support debt market development which are also supported through policy reforms. Finally, strengthening oversight over SOEs <span id = \"word\">and</span> public investment management should be prioritized to ensure that the country\\x92s investment portfolio generates social <span id = \"word\">and</span> economic returns that enhance social <span id = \"word\">and</span> economic well-being.

Mozambique\\x92s private sector is diverse and remains largely underdeveloped. The pace and depth of reforms remains uneven and the business environment remains costly, time-consuming, and restrictive. Access to finance is a particular concern, with majority of MSME owners financially excluded. Ensuring continued financial system stability is vital for continuing to promote access to financial services as well as minimizing possible contingent <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> liabilities stemming from potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The country\\x92s geographic position between Southeastern Africa and the large economies of South and Southeast Asia offers a great opportunity to develop logistical corridors and foster growth; however, high trade costs limit potential trade growth. To realize the national priority of promoting jobs and improving Mozambique\\x92s overall productivity and competitiveness, the Government is committed to strengthening private sector development as the main engine for propelling inclusive growth of incomes and employment in a sustainable way across a more diversified economic base. Success is predicated on accelerated improvement in investment climate and quality of business regulations, management and entrepreneurship capacity building, commercial connectivity of value-adding supply chains across most growth-promising sectors, and through agglomeration of economies generated through integrated interventions supported by increased trade openness and investor-friendly trade policies and administrative regimes which would facilitate transformation to a more adaptive, diversified, and resilient economy. The CPF will seek to contribute to strengthening the private sector through an integrated strategy which addresses the business environment, trade facilitation, access to infrastructure (energy and transport/logistics), and finance. In the financial sector, the program will support the adoption and implementation of reforms that can improve the enabling environment in this space. In addition, the APEI Regional DPO will support a multilateral approach of coordinated implementation of reforms. . 7.

Increased economic diversification requires addressing weaknesses in the electricity sector which affect the overall development of both rural and urban households and firms. Only 25.5 percent of the population has access to the electric power grid, with much lower coverage in rural areas. The physical condition of the electricity system is poor, with frequent breakdowns, high rates of electricity losses, and little redundancy. The utility company is illprepared to respond to the country\\x92s ambitious goals for electricity development and needs to become more efficient. To improve its resilience and coverage and/or to be able to export more power, the transmission system needs to be extensively refurbished and expanded. The private sector could play a substantial role in developing the potentially large energy sector projects, and the proceeds from regional energy <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> could be used to <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> access and system expansion at the national level. The legal and enabling environments for attracting the private sector need to be strengthened so that Mozambique can attract additional private sector financing for the power sector. Through implementation of the World Bank Group Energy Joint Implementation Plan for  Mozambique, the CPF will contribute to the provision of more reliable and efficient electricity supply, as well as to the development of additional generation capacity and developing opportunities for regional <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> through the strengthening of transmission networks. IDA financing will focus primarily on grid rehabilitation and improvement of utility performance and on the expansion of the transmission system. IDA will, in parallel, support the development of an electrification strategy for the country, which would be supported in the earlier years of the CPF. IDA and IFC will work to improve the enabling environment to attract the necessary private sector financing to develop the sector. IFC investment and MIGA guarantees will support private sector-driven generation investment (grid and off-grid), contingent on implementation of legal and regulatory reforms to address issues that impede private investment in the sector. Developing institutional arrangements for improving performance of the utility and ensuring the sector is financially viable will be an important part of the program and may also be supported through DPOs. . 10.

The agricultural sector (including livestock, fisheries, and forestry) engages three-quarters of the population and rural <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> is closely related to low agricultural productivity. Agriculture offers scope to narrow persistent income disparities between rural and <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> areas and to reduce <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> in regions that benefitted little from the economic gains of recent years. The high potential areas for agriculture stretch across most of the northern and central regions, with good potential for high-performing crop combinations. Mozambique has gradually developed a substantial policy and strategic framework for increasing agriculture productivity but growth remains slow due to a number of constraining factors. The CPF program will contribute to unlocking the agriculture sector\\x92s potential by (a) increasing agriculture and forestry productivity by providing farmers, natural forest operators, and planation growers with access to productivity-enhancing inputs, technologies, rural credit, expanded irrigation, and access to markets and training; (b) promoting agribusiness development of large-, medium-, and small-scale commercial agriculture, agro-processing, and forestry value chains; (c) supporting better road infrastructure improving linkages between smallholders and agribusiness companies and general access to both national and regional markets for agriculture and forestry products; and (d) enhancing land tenure security. The interventions will also strengthen institutions to improve the delivery of services. 4.

Despite rapid economic growth in the past two decades, over half of Mozambique\\x92s population today is still poor and highly vulnerable. Although <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> is\\npredominantly rural, an additional 3.2 million poor people live in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> areas with an accelerated <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization process. Moreover, a large share of the\\npopulation is close to the <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> line, making these groups vulnerable to small variations in income and transient <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span>. Overall, the coverage of social\\nprotection programs in Mozambique is low, with an estimated 14 percent of poor benefiting from safety nets interventions. The CPF will contribute to the\\nexpansion of safety nets to significantly reduce <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> over a relatively short period. To achieve a sustainable reduction in <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span>, productive inclusion\\nactivities (activation programs, skills transfers, savings, financial literacy, micro-credits, and so on) and human development interventions (nutrition) will\\ncomplement cash transfer schemes under the productive safety nets. Due to the specific challenges in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings, the rapid <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization process and the\\npotential impact of a possible fuel subsidy reform, the World Bank will support the design and implementation of specific safety nets and productive inclusion\\ninterventions in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings.

Public spending in Mozambique is marked by significant regional disparities, with the poorest and most populous provinces typically receiving the lowest per\\ncapita expenditures. This is related to Mozambique\\x92s decentralization process to date, which remains incomplete and has suffered reversals. At the same time,\\nthe <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> population has been growing at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although <span id = \"word\">Poverty</span> has declined faster in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> areas, <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization has not\\nyet yielded its full potential.

"para": "c(\"Increasing Agriculture Growth . The agricultural sector (including livestock, fisheries, and forestry) engages three-quarters of the population and rural poverty is closely related to low agricultural productivity. Agriculture offers scope to narrow persistent income disparities between rural and <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> areas and to reduce poverty in regions that benefitted little from the economic gains of recent years. The high potential areas for agriculture stretch across most of the northern and central regions, with good potential for high-performing crop combinations. Mozambique has gradually developed a substantial policy and strategic framework for increasing agriculture productivity but growth remains slow due to a number of constraining factors. The CPF program will contribute to unlocking the agriculture sector\\x92s potential by (a) increasing agriculture and forestry productivity by providing farmers, natural forest operators, and planation growers with access to productivity-enhancing inputs, technologies, rural credit, expanded irrigation, and access to markets and training; (b) promoting agribusiness development of large-, medium-, and small-scale commercial agriculture, agro-processing, and forestry value chains; (c) supporting better road infrastructure improving linkages between smallholders and agribusiness companies and general access to both national and regional markets for agriculture and forestry products; and (d) enhancing land tenure security.

Despite rapid economic growth in the past two decades, over half of Mozambique\\x92s population today is still poor and highly vulnerable. Although poverty is\\npredominantly rural, an additional 3.2 million poor people live in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> areas with an accelerated <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization process. Moreover, a large share of the\\npopulation is close to the poverty line, making these groups vulnerable to small variations in income and transient poverty. Overall, the coverage of social\\nprotection programs in Mozambique is low, with an estimated 14 percent of poor benefiting from safety nets interventions. The CPF will contribute to the\\nexpansion of safety nets to significantly reduce poverty over a relatively short period. To achieve a sustainable reduction in poverty, productive inclusion\\nactivities (activation programs, skills transfers, savings, financial literacy, micro-credits, and so on) and human development interventions (nutrition) will\\ncomplement cash transfer schemes under the productive safety nets. Due to the specific challenges in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings, the rapid <span id = \"word\">Urban</span>ization process and the\\npotential impact of a possible fuel subsidy reform, the World Bank will support the design and implementation of specific safety nets and productive inclusion\\ninterventions in <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> settings.

At the same time,\\nthe <span id = \"word\">Urban</span> population has been growing at a faster rate than the rest of the country.

The WBG contribution to this area aims at increasing resilience to high levels of short-term\\nweather variability and longer-term climate change and by strengthening planning and disaster-risk management capacity. The WBG support will focus on\\nbuilding the national capacity for climate change adaptation and resilience, through institutional and policy development to address climate change and disaster\\nrisk reduction, enhancing adoption of climate-smart resources management practices, and integrating climate risk assessments into planning and infrastructure\\ndevelopment. Mozambique is well endowed with renewable natural resources, particularly forests and fisheries, which can generate a steady flow of benefits\\nto poor rural communities if well managed. These benefits include rural income, improved nutrition, more resilient ecosystems, and hence decreased natural\\ncatastrophes and more productive agriculture. Renewable natural resources tend to be closest to the poorest population, particularly those in remote areas;\\nhence, their sustainable management directly contributes not only to reduce poverty but also to shared prosperity. In forestry, the CPF program will promote\\nreduction of forest cover loss through traditional grant financing and innovative performance-based payments (emissions reductions payments). In wildlife\\nconservation, the program will promote sustainable use of protected areas to generate income streams through nature-based tourism, conservation agriculture,\\nand non-timber forest products value chains, among others. In fisheries, the program promotes food security and nutrition, job creation for rural coastal\\npopulations, and increased income to fishing communities. 25.
