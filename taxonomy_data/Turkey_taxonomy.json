Increasing efficiency in the use of public assets and natural capital is highlighted in the SCD as a key development challenge.\\nIn particular, improving the efficiency of <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> consumption is critical for Turkey\\x92s competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. The WBG\\x92s\\nprogram in <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> efficiency has ongoing IBRD investments through the SME <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> Efficiency project and the Private Sector Renewable <span id = \"word\">Energy</span>\\nand <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> Efficiency project as well as a broad program of IFC financing to sustainable and renewable <span id = \"word\">Energy</span>. These projects will continue to be\\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> efficiency in public buildings through a\\npossible new investment operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments and markets through a grant-funded\\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\\nconsumption. IBRD\\x92s new social and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\\non social and environmental social sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the forestry\\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\\nIFC will continue to support private sector investments in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\\n<span id = \"word\">Energy</span> efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on <span id = \"word\">Energy</span>\\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\\nfor resource efficiency both directly through investments in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds. At the municipal level, it will seek opportunities to support\\n<span id = \"word\">Energy</span>-efficient public transport, municipal buildings, water and wastewater, and street lighting projects. In addition to financing, IFC will provide\\nadvisory support and training to key institutions and corporates to help introduce new <span id = \"word\">Energy</span> efficiency practices to Turkey\\x92s residential housing and\\nindustrial sectors.

The focus of the WBG\\x92s program in the health sector is on promoting healthy lifestyles through attacking behavioral risks. An\\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\\ninterventions <span id = \"word\">and</span> payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, <span id = \"word\">and</span> on its experience in financing\\nTurkey\\x92s first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkey\\x92s health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\\nTurkey\\x92s first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA <span id = \"word\">and</span> EBRD\\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social <span id = \"word\">and</span> other infrastructure projects on a selective\\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized services (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkey\\x92s health PPP program through providing guarantees <span id = \"word\">and</span> credit enhancement.\\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA <span id = \"word\">and</span> TIMSS scores for Turkey <span id = \"word\">and</span> also help the\\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, <span id = \"word\">and</span> distance education approaches. Given the time required\\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest <span id = \"word\">and</span> achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (\\x80150 million) which aims to exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> education service delivery <span id = \"word\">and</span> targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education <span id = \"word\">and</span> vocational system. In\\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting <span id = \"word\">Youth</span> who have dropped out <span id = \"word\">and</span> are at risk of low education levels <span id = \"word\">and</span> vulnerable to poverty will\\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish <span id = \"word\">Youth</span> is high <span id = \"word\">and</span> where SuTP <span id = \"word\">Youth</span> are at risk of never entering school.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally <span id = \"word\">and</span> socially\\nsustainable <span id = \"word\">and</span> resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC <span id = \"word\">and</span> MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure <span id = \"word\">and</span> capital investment planning, <span id = \"word\">and</span> efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier <span id = \"word\">and</span> underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors <span id = \"word\">and</span> the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Exp<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness <span id = \"word\">and</span> an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning <span id = \"word\">and</span> related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities <span id = \"word\">and</span> their investment plans, <span id = \"word\">and</span> it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social <span id = \"word\">and</span> financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing L<span id = \"word\">and</span> Registry <span id = \"word\">and</span> Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing <span id = \"word\">and</span> enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations.

Increasing efficiency in the use of public assets and natural capital is highlighted in the SCD as a key development challenge.\nIn particular, improving the efficiency of energy consumption is critical for Turkeys competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. The WBGs\nprogram in energy efficiency has ongoing IBRD investments through the SME Energy Efficiency project and the Private Sector Renewable Energy\nand Energy Efficiency project as well as a broad program of IFC financing to sustainable and renewable energy. These projects will continue to be\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to energy efficiency in public buildings through a\npossible new investment operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments and markets through a grant-funded\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\nconsumption. IBRDs new social and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\non social and environmental social sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the <span id = \"word\">Forestry</span>\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\nIFC will continue to support private sector investments in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\nenergy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on energy\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce energy intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\nfor resource efficiency both directly through investments in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds. At the municipal level, it will seek opportunities to support\nenergy-efficient public transport, municipal buildings, water and wastewater, and street lighting projects. In addition to financing, IFC will provide\nadvisory support and training to key institutions and corporates to help introduce new energy efficiency practices to Turkeys residential housing and\nindustrial sectors.

Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and socially\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social and financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an investment project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for financial management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation. IFC can leverage a wide range of products including long-term loans (both in euros and lira),\\nmunicipal bonds, and hedging tools to help municipalities manage their foreign-exchange loans. Building on successes in Istanbul and Izmir, IFC\\naims to help other credit-worthy cities create a pipeline of bankable projects, providing technical assistance and capacity building, direct senior\\nloans (in euros or lira) or using a portfolio approach by channeling its funds to cities through local banks.

The focus of the WBG\\x92s program in the health sector is on promoting healthy lifestyles through attacking behavioral risks. An\\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\\nTurkey\\x92s first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkey\\x92s health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\\nand through <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\\nTurkey\\x92s first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized services (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkey\\x92s health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (\\x80150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system. In\\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting youth who have dropped out and are at risk of low education levels and vulnerable to poverty will\\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish youth is high and where SuTP youth are at risk of never entering school. IFC will look for\\nopportunities to invest in education service clients to promote private vocational training..

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and socially\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social and <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an investment project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for <span id = \"word\">Financial</span> management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation. IFC can leverage a wide range of products including long-term loans (both in euros and lira),\\nmunicipal bonds, and hedging tools to help municipalities manage their foreign-exchange loans. Building on successes in Istanbul and Izmir, IFC\\naims to help other credit-worthy cities create a pipeline of bankable projects, providing technical assistance and capacity building, direct senior\\nloans (in euros or lira) or using a portfolio approach by channeling its funds to cities through local banks.

"para": "Strengthened Performance of the Education and Health Sectors. The focus of the WBGs program in the health sector is on promoting healthy lifestyles through attacking behavioral risks. An\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\nTurkeys first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkeys health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\nand through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\nTurkeys first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized services (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkeys health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system. In\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting youth who have dropped out and are at risk of low education levels and vulnerable to poverty will\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish youth is high and where SuTP youth are at risk of never entering school.

Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC <span id = \"word\">and</span> MIGA.

Exp<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness <span id = \"word\">and</span> an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning <span id = \"word\">and</span> related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities <span id = \"word\">and</span> their investment plans, <span id = \"word\">and</span> it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social <span id = \"word\">and</span> financial sustainability challenges.

A FRiT-funded labor market inclusion project (\\x8050\\nmillion, under preparation <span id = \"word\">and</span> expected to be approved in mid-2017) targets increased SuTP participation in the labor market through providing\\naccess to ALMPs. This is complemented by FRiT funding of \\x805 million for IBRD advisory work to support facilitation of employment <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\nentrepreneurship opportunities in SuTP-affected regions. Further IBRD <span id = \"word\">and</span>/or EU investments will be considered where there is client dem<span id = \"word\">and</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span>\\na link to the twin goals; one area under discussion is livelihood support for SuTPs in the agri-food sector. The WBG is also providing support to\\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for managing migration in the labor market.\\nUnder this objective, IFC aims to invest in projects that promote greater equity in the access of vulnerable <span id = \"word\">and</span> underserved groups to services, jobs,\\n<span id = \"word\">and</span> finance. IFC will scale up its SME financing targeted to women entrepreneurs <span id = \"word\">and</span> farmers <span id = \"word\">and</span> will leverage NBFIs to broaden access to finance\\nfor these groups. It will also invest in key manufacturing companies with presence in the south east region with a view to support employment in\\nthe region. Aiming to help underserved populations access better urban services, IFC will pursue investment opportunities in commercially-viable\\nurban infrastructure projects in second-tier, less developed regions. In addition, IFC will offer advisory services to Turkish corporates to help them\\ndevelop gender programs that support women\\x92s employment <span id = \"word\">and</span> entrepreneurship.

This CPF objective has the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness in social assistance and strengthening the\\nevidence-base for policies aiming to narrow gaps between regions and ensure greater inclusion of vulnerable groups. In this context, the WBG will\\ncontinue its support to making the social assistance system more effective and efficient. The ASA program will continue to produce and\\ndisseminate <span id = \"word\">Monetary</span> and non-<span id = \"word\">Monetary</span> indicators of welfare and inclusion, including equality of opportunity and multi-dimensional poverty, and\\nprovide technical assistance to the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Social Assistance Reform initiative of the Ministry of Family and Social Policies (MoFSP).

WBG support under this objective aims to bring more people \\x96 especially women and youth \\x96 into the formal labor market.\\nThe Bank intends to continue its role of providing a comprehensive package of ASA and propose reform recommendations which can guide\\nGovernment decision-making and could in turn be supported through DPLs. The influx of SuTPs has created new challenges among the labor force,\\nparticularly for those in the south-east which is hosting the largest concentration of SuTPs. The WBG will help to address these issues through\\ncontinued <span id = \"word\">Policy</span> advice (supported by EU and SIDA trust funds) and some project interventions. A FRiT-funded labor market inclusion project (\\x8050\\nmillion, under preparation and expected to be approved in mid-2017) targets increased SuTP participation in the labor market through providing\\naccess to ALMPs. This is complemented by FRiT funding of \\x805 million for IBRD advisory work to support facilitation of employment and\\nentrepreneurship opportunities in SuTP-affected regions. Further IBRD and/or EU investments will be considered where there is client demand and\\na link to the twin goals; one area under discussion is livelihood support for SuTPs in the agri-food sector. The WBG is also providing support to\\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for managing migration in the labor market.\\nUnder this objective, IFC aims to invest in projects that promote greater equity in the access of vulnerable and underserved groups to services, jobs,\\nand finance. IFC will scale up its SME financing targeted to women entrepreneurs and farmers and will leverage NBFIs to broaden access to finance\\nfor these groups. It will also invest in key manufacturing companies with presence in the south east region with a view to support employment in\\nthe region. Aiming to help underserved populations access better urban services, IFC will pursue investment opportunities in commercially-viable\\nurban infrastructure projects in second-tier, less developed regions. In addition, IFC will offer advisory services to Turkish corporates to help them\\ndevelop gender programs that support women\\x92s employment and entrepreneurship.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and socially\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on <span id = \"word\">Policy</span> and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand <span id = \"word\">Policy</span> analysis to help cities address environmental, social and financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an investment project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for financial management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation.

An\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\nTurkeys first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkeys health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\nand through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\nTurkeys first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized <span id = \"word\">Services</span> (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\ninvestors.

IBRD will continue to work with the state\\nbanks, development banks and other financial institutions through new lending operations that provide long-term financial sources that extend access\\nto finance, incentivize investors in key sectors, and deepen and diversify instruments. IFC will continue to work with financial institutions and\\nintermediaries to expand the availability of funding to MSMEs, with a particular focus on rural areas, women-owned enterprises, and agribusinesses.\\nIt will continue to (i) support banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) with longer-term funds to help them scale-up support to the\\nunderserved and unbanked, (ii) leverage diverse instruments and means of funding; (iii) utilize interest rate and currency swaps for real sector clients,\\nPPP <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s and municipalities; and (iv) promote alternative debt instruments such as covered bonds, diversified payment rights (DPRs), green\\nbonds, municipal bonds, PPP project bonds (both in Lira and hard currency).

Strengthening the financial sector is critical to achieve faster, private sector-led growth which requires addressing structural\\nchallenges, moving away from a bank-centric financial system, deepening and diversifying financial and capital markets and broadening access to\\nfinance to capture under-served segments (MSMEs and women). The focus of the CPF will be on delivering relevant ASA that will help inform\\ngovernment policy and underpin future <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s by IBRD and IFC. The ASA program will cover critical issues such as financial sector\\ndiversification, pensions, capital market and analysis of sector headwinds and how to respond to them.

The focus of the WBG\\x92s program in the health sector is on promoting healthy lifestyles through attacking behavioral risks. An\\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\\nTurkey\\x92s first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkey\\x92s health sector through <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s in specialized health service providers,\\nand through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\\nTurkey\\x92s first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized services (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkey\\x92s health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (\\x80150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system. In\\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting youth who have dropped out and are at risk of low education levels and vulnerable to poverty will\\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish youth is high and where SuTP youth are at risk of never entering school. IFC will look for\\nopportunities to invest in education service clients to promote private vocational training.. Increased percentage of formal school\\nenrolment of SuTP children aged 6-15\\nBaseline: 469,495 children accessing\\neducation (149,439 in formal education and\\n320,056 in temporary education centers: ratio\\nis 32%)\\nTarget: 600,000 children accessing education\\n(40% in formal education), 50-50 split of\\nmale-female children\\nImprovement of primary and secondary\\nprevention of non-communicable diseases\\n(NCDs)\\nBaseline (2015): 10% change of target\\npopulation using services of Healthy Living\\nCenters\\nTarget: 50%\\nNumber of Patients Served through IFC heath\\nsector clients\\nBaseline: 0 (2015)\\nTarget: 14.0 million (2019)\\n(Gender disaggregated data being collected)\", \n\"Improved reliability of energy supply and generation of green energy. The WBG\\x92s current program is heavily concentrated in the energy sector, with IBRD policy advice and TA paving the way for\\nstepped-up private sector engagement supported by IFC and MIGA. It encompasses: (i) increasing the percentage of renewable electricity generation\\nand improving its integration into the grid through the ongoing Renewable Energy Integration, the Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy\\nEfficiency, the Geothermal Development and the EU/IPA Energy Sector TA Projects; (ii) enhancing energy security and gas storage capacity through\\nthe on-going Gas Sector Development Project and the proposed Gas Storage Expansion Project; (iii) developing energy trading and restructuring\\nBOTAS through the EU/IPA Energy Sector TA Project; and (iv) securing and diversifying Turkey\\x92s gas supply with gas imports from Azerbaijan\\nthrough the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) Project \\x96 where $800 million in IBRD loans to Turkey\\x92s BOTA? and Azerbaijan\\x92s SGC leveraged\\n$600 million from the Asian Infrastructure <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> Bank (AIIB) and the expectation of up to $1.2 billion in guarantees from MIGA. Given the\\ncomparative advantage of IBRD engagement in the sector, further energy <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s may follow, on client demand, observing the WBG\\x92s cascade\\napproach on leveraging private financing as needed and appropriate. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA will work closely together to help Turkey improve its\\nPPP policy framework to stimulate further private sector energy <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s, strengthen the energy regulatory environment, and increase long-term\\nfinancing for renewable energy. This ASA will also feed into the design of future DPLs, which could stimulate <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s in renewable energy\\ngeneration and transmission and the related <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change benefits.\\nIFC aims to support Turkey\\x92s energy security, and help rebalance its energy mix through selective, and strategic engagements in the sector\\nand will seek out <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s where IFC can play a mobilization role, particularly in the form of FDIs. IFC will provide long-term finance to\\ndistribution companies to upgrade the distribution network. IFC also aims to help power companies address currency mismatches by offering suitable\\nfinancing schemes to hedge their foreign exchange risks. IFC will seek <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> opportunities in new technologies (e.g. smart meters) to\\nhelp address some of the problems in the power distribution sector. In addition, IFC will look for opportunities to support shortages in\\ngas supply through <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s in gas infrastructure including import terminals and storage as well as gas distribution. MIGA remains\\nopen to supporting FDI in the renewable space through the provision of political risk insurance guarantees.. Renewable electricity generation as\\npercentage of total generation (%).\\nBaseline: 31.5% in 2015\\nTarget: 33% in 2021\\nValue of loans provided by IFC clients to\\nrenewable projects\\nBaseline: $38m (2015)\\nTarget: $66m (2019) Total power generation and distribution\\nclients reached (IFC) (millions)\\nBaseline: 4.33 (2015)\\nTarget: 6.89 (2019)\\nIncreased capacity of gas storage (bcm).\\nBaseline: 2.8 bcm in 2016\\nTarget: 3.8 bcm in 2021\\nGas imports through TANAP (bcm/annum).\\nBaseline: 0 in 2016\\nTarget: 5 in 2021\", \n\"Improved sustainability and resilience of cities. The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and socially\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change planning and related <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\n<span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social and financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for financial management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation. IFC can leverage a wide range of products including long-term loans (both in euros and lira),\\nmunicipal bonds, and hedging tools to help municipalities manage their foreign-exchange loans. Building on successes in Istanbul and Izmir, IFC\\naims to help other credit-worthy cities create a pipeline of bankable projects, providing technical assistance and capacity building, direct senior\\nloans (in euros or lira) or using a portfolio approach by channeling its funds to cities through local banks.

The WBG\\x92s\\nprogram in energy efficiency has ongoing IBRD <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s through the SME Energy Efficiency project and the Private Sector Renewable Energy\\nand Energy Efficiency project as well as a broad program of IFC financing to sustainable and renewable energy. These projects will continue to be\\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to energy efficiency in public buildings through a\\npossible new <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments and markets through a grant-funded\\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\\nconsumption. IBRD\\x92s new social and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\\non social and environmental social sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the forestry\\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\\nIFC will continue to support private sector <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\\nenergy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on energy\\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce energy intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\\nfor resource efficiency both directly through <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds. At the municipal level, it will seek opportunities to support\\nenergy-efficient public transport, municipal buildings, water and wastewater, and street lighting projects. In addition to financing, IFC will provide\\nadvisory support and training to key institutions and corporates to help introduce new energy efficiency practices to Turkey\\x92s residential housing and\\nindustrial sectors. MIGA remains open to expanding its support to municipal infrastructure with a view to improving energy efficiency and reducing\\noverall emission levels. In this regard, MIGA could provide credit guarantees for major municipal infrastructure projects, similar to previous\\nassistance to Istanbul and Izmir.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and <span id = \"word\">Social</span>ly\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand policy <span id = \"word\">Analysis</span> to help cities address environmental, <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an investment project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for financial management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation. IFC can leverage a wide range of products including long-term loans (both in euros and lira),\\nmunicipal bonds, and hedging tools to help municipalities manage their foreign-exchange loans. Building on successes in Istanbul and Izmir, IFC\\naims to help other credit-worthy cities create a pipeline of bankable projects, providing technical assistance and capacity building, direct senior\\nloans (in euros or lira) or using a portfolio approach by channeling its funds to cities through local banks. Improved service delivery and expanded\\naccess to digital land registry and cadaster\\ninformation\\nIncreased customer satisfaction at national\\nlevel\\nBaseline: 85% in 2016\\nTarget: 95% in 2021\\nNumber of additional people benefitting from\\nimproved urban infrastructure through IBRD\\nand IFC financing (number in millions)\\nBaseline: 3.3 (2015)\\nTarget: 4.7 (2019)\\n(Gender disaggregated data to be collected)\\nIncreased resilience of cities through number\\nof disaster resilient public buildings\\nretrofitted, reconstructed, or newly\\nconstructed through IBRD and FRIT\\nfinancing\\nBaseline: 0\\nTarget: 110 by 2021\", \n\"Increased sustainability of infrastructure assets and natural capital. Increasing efficiency in the use of public assets and natural capital is highlighted in the SCD as a key development challenge.\\nIn particular, improving the efficiency of energy consumption is critical for Turkey\\x92s competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. The WBG\\x92s\\nprogram in energy efficiency has ongoing IBRD investments through the SME Energy Efficiency project and the Private Sector Renewable Energy\\nand Energy Efficiency project as well as a broad program of IFC financing to sustainable and renewable energy. These projects will continue to be\\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to energy efficiency in public buildings through a\\npossible new investment operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments and markets through a grant-funded\\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\\nconsumption. IBRD\\x92s new <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\\non <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and environmental <span id = \"word\">Social</span> sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the forestry\\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\\nIFC will continue to support private sector investments in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\\nenergy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on energy\\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce energy intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\\nfor resource efficiency both directly through investments in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds. At the municipal level, it will seek opportunities to support\\nenergy-efficient public transport, municipal buildings, water and wastewater, and street lighting projects. In addition to financing, IFC will provide\\nadvisory support and training to key institutions and corporates to help introduce new energy efficiency practices to Turkey\\x92s residential housing and\\nindustrial sectors. MIGA remains open to expanding its support to municipal infrastructure with a view to improving energy efficiency and reducing\\noverall emission levels. In this regard, MIGA could provide credit guarantees for major municipal infrastructure projects, similar to previous\\nassistance to Istanbul and Izmir.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and <span id = \"word\">Social</span>ly\\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkey\\x92s \\x93Smart Cities\\x94 approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\\nIFC under the joint \\x93Sustainable Cities Program\\x94, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRD\\x92s support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRD\\x92s lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\\nand policy analysis to help cities address environmental, <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and financial sustainability challenges. An ongoing Land Registry and Cadastre\\nModernization project also contributes to improving local government financing and enhancing service delivery to citizens through increased access\\nto property market information, including valuations. For improving the resilience of cities, IBRD could also deliver an investment project aiming\\nto strengthen critical public facilities for earthquake resistance and to support better enforcement of building codes and land use plans.\\nFocus areas for IFC and MIGA include direct engagement with municipalities to strengthen their capacity for financial management, infrastructure\\nproject design, preparation and implementation. IFC can leverage a wide range of products including long-term loans (both in euros and lira),\\nmunicipal bonds, and hedging tools to help municipalities manage their foreign-exchange loans. Building on successes in Istanbul and Izmir, IFC\\naims to help other credit-worthy cities create a pipeline of bankable projects, providing technical assistance and capacity building, direct senior\\nloans (in euros or lira) or using a portfolio approach by channeling its funds to cities through local banks. Improved service delivery and expanded\\naccess to digital land registry and cadaster\\ninformation\\nIncreased customer satisfaction at national\\nlevel\\nBaseline: 85% in 2016\\nTarget: 95% in 2021\\nNumber of additional people benefitting from\\nimproved urban infrastructure through IBRD\\nand IFC financing (number in millions)\\nBaseline: 3.3 (2015)\\nTarget: 4.7 (2019)\\n(Gender disaggregated data to be collected)\\nIncreased resilience of cities through number\\nof disaster resilient public buildings\\nretrofitted, reconstructed, or newly\\nconstructed through IBRD and FRIT\\nfinancing\\nBaseline: 0\\nTarget: 110 by 2021\", \n\"Increased sustainability of infrastructure assets and natural capital. Increasing efficiency in the use of public assets and natural capital is highlighted in the SCD as a key development challenge.\\nIn particular, improving the efficiency of energy consumption is critical for Turkey\\x92s competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. The WBG\\x92s\\nprogram in energy efficiency has ongoing IBRD investments through the SME Energy Efficiency project and the Private Sector Renewable Energy\\nand Energy Efficiency project as well as a broad program of IFC financing to sustainable and renewable energy. These projects will continue to be\\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to energy efficiency in public buildings through a\\npossible new investment operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of carbon pricing instruments and markets through a grant-funded\\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\\nconsumption. IBRD\\x92s new <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\\non <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and environmental <span id = \"word\">Social</span> sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the forestry\\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\\nIFC will continue to support private sector investments in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\\nenergy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on energy\\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce energy intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\\nfor resource efficiency both directly through investments in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds. At the municipal level, it will seek opportunities to support\\nenergy-efficient public transport, municipal buildings, water and wastewater, and street lighting projects. In addition to financing, IFC will provide\\nadvisory support and training to key institutions and corporates to help introduce new energy efficiency practices to Turkey\\x92s residential housing and\\nindustrial sectors. MIGA remains open to expanding its support to municipal infrastructure with a view to improving energy efficiency and reducing\\noverall emission levels. In this regard, MIGA could provide credit guarantees for major municipal infrastructure projects, similar to previous\\nassistance to Istanbul and Izmir.

The WBG is also providing support to\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for managing migration in the labor market.\nUnder this objective, IFC aims to invest in projects that promote greater equity in the access of vulnerable and underserved groups to services, jobs,\nand finance. IFC will scale up its SME financing targeted to women entrepreneurs and farmers and will leverage NBFIs to broaden access to finance\nfor these groups. It will also invest in key manufacturing companies with presence in the south east region with a view to support <span id = \"word\">Employment</span> in\nthe region. Aiming to help underserved populations access better urban services, IFC will pursue investment opportunities in commercially-viable\nurban infrastructure projects in second-tier, less developed regions.
