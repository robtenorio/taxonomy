These projects will continue to be\nimplemented with follow-on or scaled-up projects based on client demand, including support to energy efficiency in public buildings through a\npossible new investment operation. IBRD is also supporting the development of <span id = \"word\">Carbon</span> <span id = \"word\">Pricing</span> instruments and markets through a grant-funded\nPartnership for Market Readiness (PMR) project. The ASA program is supporting the efficient use of wood fuels (and future stepped-up engagement\ncould be envisaged) and a study on how to finance Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #12 which focuses on sustainable production and\nconsumption. IBRDs new social and environmental framework will serve as a solid ground for furthering dialogue and building in-country capacity\non social and environmental social sustainability policies and analytical work. The WBG will also advocate a stepped-up program in areas identified\nin the SCD as important, such as the sustainable use of water and forest resources. This would support some of the most vulnerable groups in Turkey,\nnamely, smallholder farmers and forest communities. In the water sector, a possible IBRD irrigation project is under discussion. In the forestry\nsector, recommendations from the recent Forest Policy Note have led to discussions of a potential project. Engagement in agriculture is also possible.\nFinally, the WBG is providing EU-funded TA on transport issues and some of this work could lead to financing opportunities during the CPF period.\nIFC will continue to support private sector investments in manufacturing, SMEs, municipal and transport infrastructure, with a view to improving\nenergy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. IFC will also provide long-term funding to intermediaries with portfolios focused on energy\nefficiency areas and seek direct engagements at the industrial level to help reduce energy intensity and pollution. IFC will continue to expand finance\nfor resource efficiency both directly through investments in manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors, and through financial institutions, e.g.\nthrough innovative instruments such as green bonds and mortgage-covered bonds.

WBG support under this objective aims to bring more people  especially women and youth  into the formal labor market.\nThe Bank intends to continue its role of providing a comprehensive package of ASA and propose reform recommendations which can guide\nGovernment decision-making and could in turn be supported through DPLs. The influx of SuTPs has created new challenges among the labor force,\nparticularly for those in the south-east which is hosting the largest concentration of SuTPs. The WBG will help to address these issues through\ncontinued policy advice (supported by EU and SIDA trust funds) and some project interventions. A FRiT-funded labor market inclusion project (50\nmillion, under preparation and expected to be approved in mid-2017) targets increased SuTP participation in the labor market through providing\naccess to ALMPs. This is complemented by FRiT funding of 5 million for IBRD advisory work to support facilitation of employment and\nentrepreneurship opportunities in SuTP-affected regions. Further IBRD and/or EU investments will be considered where there is client demand and\na link to the twin goals; one area under discussion is livelihood support for SuTPs in the agri-food sector. The WBG is also providing support to\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for managing migration in the labor market.\nUnder this objective, IFC aims to invest in projects that promote greater equity in the access of vulnerable and underserved groups to services, jobs,\nand finance. IFC will scale up its SME financing targeted to women entrepreneurs and farmers and will leverage NBFIs to broaden access to finance\nfor these groups. It will also invest in key manufacturing companies with presence in the south east region with a view to support employment in\nthe region.

In particular, IBRDs support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRDs lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage.

WBG support under this objective aims to bring more people  especially women and youth  into the formal labor market.\nThe Bank intends to continue its role of providing a comprehensive package of ASA and propose reform recommendations which can guide\nGovernment decision-making and could in turn be supported through DPLs. The influx of SuTPs has created new challenges among the labor force,\nparticularly for those in the south-east which is hosting the largest concentration of SuTPs. The WBG will help to address these issues through\ncontinued policy advice (supported by EU and SIDA trust funds) and some project interventions. A FRiT-funded labor market inclusion project (50\nmillion, under preparation and expected to be approved in mid-2017) targets increased SuTP participation in the labor market through providing\naccess to ALMPs. This is complemented by FRiT funding of 5 million for IBRD advisory work to support facilitation of employment and\nentrepreneurship opportunities in SuTP-affected regions. Further IBRD and/or EU investments will be considered where there is client demand and\na link to the twin goals; one area under discussion is livelihood support for SuTPs in the agri-food sector. The WBG is also providing support to\ndevise a comprehensive strategy for managing migration in the labor market.\nUnder this objective, IFC aims to invest in projects that promote greater equity in the access of vulnerable and underserved groups to services, jobs,\nand <span id = \"word\">Finance</span>.

An\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\nTurkeys first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkeys health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\nand through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\nTurkeys first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized services (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkeys health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system.

An\nongoing IBRD-financed health project aims to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) for evidence-based policy making, increase the\nmanagement capacity of hospitals, and improve the prevention of selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs). IBRD will continue to support the\nsecond phase of the health transformation program through activities focusing on providing appropriate high-quality care by results-based\ninterventions and payment reforms. The ASA program will also focus on assessing the sustainability of health utilization, through the creation of\nmodeling tools as well as assessing utilization patterns. Building on reforms implemented with IBRD support, and on its experience in financing\nTurkeys first health PPP projects, IFC will continue to support Turkeys health sector through investments in specialized health service providers,\nand through financial innovation to help create alternative capital market solutions for financing health sector projects. For example, IFC financed\nTurkeys first greenfield infrastructure PPP bond issuance under the Elazig Health PPP project, which was also supported by MIGA and EBRD\nthrough credit enhancement products. IFC will support such innovative financial structures for social and other infrastructure projects on a selective\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized <span id = \"word\">Services</span> (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkeys health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher <span id = \"word\">Training</span>, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical support to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system. In\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting youth who have dropped out and are at risk of low education levels and vulnerable to poverty will\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish youth is high and where SuTP youth are at risk of never entering school.

The WBG integrated engagement will continue to focus on helping cities to become more environmentally and socially\nsustainable and resilient through supporting Turkeys Smart Cities approach. Through the investment coordination platform between IBRD and\nIFC under the joint Sustainable Cities Program, the WBG will maintain a constructive dialogue with the central government on policy and\nregulatory changes to modernize the existing municipal financing and investment framework, thus paving the way for stepped-up private investment\nsupported by IFC and MIGA. In particular, IBRDs support to urban planning, infrastructure and capital investment planning, and efforts to improve\nmunicipal financial capacity should enable the WBG to expand its support to second-tier cities, including in frontier and underserved regions, with\nthe ultimate goal of enabling them to secure financing directly from commercial investors and the capital markets for their crucial infrastructure\nneeds. Expanding the availability of municipal finance options, improving creditworthiness and an effective municipal PPP framework are areas that\nrequire continuing WBG collaboration. Finally, advice on low-carbon urban management, climate change planning and related investment\nidentification in major urban centers will be pursued, aiming to share global best practice. IBRDs lending portfolio will continue to target strategic\ninvestments that build on known areas of comparative advantage. The Sustainable Cities program is envisaged as a series of projects, with new projects coming into the program based on the readiness of specific cities and their investment plans, and it will include EU-funded TA in planning\nand policy analysis to help cities address environmental, social and financial sustainability challenges.

IFC will <span id = \"word\">Support</span> such innovative financial structures for <span id = \"word\">Social</span> and other infrastructure projects on a selective\nbasis. In addition, IFC will invest in specialized <span id = \"word\">Services</span> (e.g., bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing), where it can play a role in bringing in strategic\ninvestors. MIGA will continue to invest in Turkeys health PPP program through providing guarantees and credit enhancement.\nIn the education sector, the CPF proposes to step up ASA in response to the recent fall in PISA and TIMSS scores for Turkey and also help the\nMinistry of National Education (MoNE) strengthen its life long learning, teacher training, and distance education approaches. Given the time required\nto impact learning, results are likely to be modest and achieved beyond the CPF timeframe. IBRD will implement a FRiT-financed education project (150 million) which aims to expand education service delivery and targets resources to vulnerable SuTP-affected areas through construction of new\nschools. IBRD is also providing technical <span id = \"word\">Support</span> to derive a strategy to integrate immigrant children into the education and vocational system. In\naddition, a new EU/IPA-funded project targeting youth who have dropped out and are at risk of low education levels and vulnerable to poverty will\nbe implemented in areas where drop-out rates of Turkish youth is high and where SuTP youth are at risk of never entering school. IFC will look for\nopportunities to invest in education service clients to promote private vocational training..
