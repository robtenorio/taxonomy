According to SCD analysis, tackling <span id = \"word\">Crime</span> and violence requires raising the opportunity costs of <span id = \"word\">Crime</span> through increased law enforcement and prevention through better opportunities. Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing violence, combining traditional focus on control and enforcement with a new emphasis on prevention through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the institutions responsible for implementation tend to be weak and under pressure to resort to short-term and repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake <span id = \"word\">Crime</span> and violence prevention activities is paramount.

Areas with the highest rates of poverty, vulnerability, violence and high child migration will be prioritized for Program expansion, including the Corredor Seco.

Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development.

In the context of ongoing trade liberalization as a result of CAFTA, Honduras is increasingly integrating into the global economy. However, it faces a number of challenges to attracting and retaining investors, both domestic and foreign. It is, therefore, critical that steps are taken to improve the overall competiveness of the country, including, among others, reinforcing the investment climate, reducing red tape, improving the regulatory framework to ensure competition and trade facilitation, enhancing land regularization and strengthening the financial sector, to attract new business, nurture and grow existing business, support diversification of exports, increase inflow of foreign investment, and increase participation of the private sector. Moreover, strengthening <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> management institutions and capacity through continued implementation of <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> <span id = \"word\">Consolidation</span> measures is critical to improving Honduras <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> position and enhancing the framework to promote competitiveness. .

Despite efforts to increase infrastructure coverage, Honduras still lags behind neighboring countries. Road density in Honduras is only 15 percent of Costa Ricas road density, and it lags behind Nicaragua, Panama, and El Salvador. Despite the importance of the road network, it has deteriorated due to limited public investment, environmental shocks, and weak institutional capacity within the state agencies responsible for paving roads. In addition, high levels of crime and violence and logistical weaknesses contribute to the high costs of road transport and further exacerbate the already slow transport time.

In 2014, the new Government developed a social development strategy and consolidated social programs for the poor called Platform Vida Mejor, including Bono Vida Mejor, under a new Secretary of Development and Social Inclusion. The Government seeks to expand coverage of the extreme poor, by enhancing the targeting of the Bono Vida Mejor Program while ensuring its fiscal sustainability. It has set a preliminary target of reaching 300,000 extreme poor families by 2017. To this end, the Programs proxy-means test has been adjusted to ensure better identification of the extreme poor, and beneficiary data is being updated using the latest vulnerability maps from the National Statistical Institute and other poverty information. Changes are also being made to the Programs eligibility rules and benefit levels to increase coverage of excluded families in extreme poverty.

Crime and <span id = \"word\">Violence</span> has become one of the main obstacles to development, but it is mostly preventable. According to SCD analysis, tackling crime and <span id = \"word\">Violence</span> requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement and <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span> through better opportunities. Thus <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span> should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing <span id = \"word\">Violence</span>, combining traditional focus on control and enforcement with a new emphasis on <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span> through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the institutions responsible for implementation tend to be weak and under pressure to resort to short-term and repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake crime and <span id = \"word\">Violence</span> <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span> activities is paramount. WBG efforts will therefore focus on building capacity at the local level to engage on citizen security issues, with an emphasis on <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span> and thus the expected outcome of this objective is enhanced government capacity to undertake crime and <span id = \"word\">Violence</span> <span id = \"word\">Prevention</span>..

The Programs objective is to protect consumption and prevent families falling into poverty in the short run, while increasing use of health and education services. In 2014, the new Government developed a <span id = \"word\">Social</span> development strategy and consolidated <span id = \"word\">Social</span> programs for the poor called Platform Vida Mejor, including Bono Vida Mejor, under a new Secretary of Development and <span id = \"word\">Social</span> <span id = \"word\">Inclusion</span>. The Government seeks to expand coverage of the extreme poor, by enhancing the targeting of the Bono Vida Mejor Program while ensuring its fiscal sustainability. It has set a preliminary target of reaching 300,000 extreme poor families by 2017. To this end, the Programs proxy-means test has been adjusted to ensure better identification of the extreme poor, and beneficiary data is being updated using the latest vulnerability maps from the National Statistical Institute and other poverty information. Changes are also being made to the Programs eligibility rules and benefit levels to increase coverage of excluded families in extreme poverty. By end 2015, the Program will begin covering students in lower secondary education (Grades 7-9), given that school dropouts tend to take place in the transition from primary (Grade 6) to lower secondary (Grade 7).  Benefits will be higher for children in lower secondary school than in primary school to reflect their higher opportunity cost and the importance of economic causes in driving the countrys high dropout rates. Moreover, benefits will be paid according to the number of children complying with co-responsibilities, instead of a flat benefit per family. Areas with the highest rates of poverty, vulnerability, violence and high child migration will be prioritized for Program expansion, including the Corredor Seco. In line with the Governments National Financial <span id = \"word\">Inclusion</span> Strategy, and as part of strengthening implementation of the Bono Vida Mejor Program, the Government also plans to partner with at least one regulated financial institution to improve the Programs payment mechanisms. The CPF will support institutional strengthening to ensure that the CCT Program is managed more efficiently, cost effectively and transparently. The expected outcome of WBG interventions under this objective is improved coverage of the extreme poor by <span id = \"word\">Social</span> programs. .
