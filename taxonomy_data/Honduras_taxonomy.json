Given the devastating impacts of natural hazards, Honduras requires significant investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> continued efforts to strengthen <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> activities aimed at enhancing resilience to climate change <span id = \"word\">and</span> natural hazards as well as addressing l<span id = \"word\">and</span> degradation <span id = \"word\">and</span> deforestation. Honduras can effectively reduce risk if public expenditure can be translated into effective prevention. Deaths <span id = \"word\">and</span> damages from natural hazards can largely be mitigated <span id = \"word\">and</span> reduced when individuals <span id = \"word\">and</span> governments take proper actions <span id = \"word\">and</span> do effective pre-disaster spending. Effective risk reduction requires an institutional setup that enables subnational governments to improve the integration of hazard risk information in development planning decisions. Improving Honduras\\x92 financial response capacity in the aftermath of disasters is also critical to reduce the country\\x92s financial vulnerability to disasters while protecting its long-term fiscal balance. The expected outcome for this objective is an increased ability of the Government to respond to natural disasters <span id = \"word\">and</span> manage climate change resilience risks. . National <span id = \"word\">and</span> municipal governments that gather, analyze, <span id = \"word\">and</span> utilize data <span id = \"word\">and</span> information on climate change adaptation <span id = \"word\">and</span> mitigation, <span id = \"word\">and</span> DRM for evidencebased policymaking <span id = \"word\">and</span> informed decision-making: Baseline (2015):  0 Target (2019):     16\", \n\"Build crime & violence prevention capacity of local government . Crime <span id = \"word\">and</span> violence has become one of the main obstacles to development, but it is mostly preventable. According to SCD analysis, tackling crime <span id = \"word\">and</span> violence requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement <span id = \"word\">and</span> prevention through better opportunities. Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security <span id = \"word\">and</span> social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional <span id = \"word\">and</span> local authorities <span id = \"word\">and</span> alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, <span id = \"word\">and</span> criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing violence, combining traditional focus on control <span id = \"word\">and</span> enforcement with a new emphasis on prevention through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the <span id = \"word\">Institutions</span> responsible for implementation tend to be weak <span id = \"word\">and</span> under pressure to resort to short-term <span id = \"word\">and</span> repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake crime <span id = \"word\">and</span> violence prevention activities is paramount. WBG efforts will therefore focus on building capacity at the local level to engage on citizen security issues, with an emphasis on prevention <span id = \"word\">and</span> thus the expected outcome of this objective is enhanced government capacity to undertake crime <span id = \"word\">and</span> violence prevention.. Communities implementing evidence-informed interventions that address the main risk factors affecting them: Baseline (2015):   8 Target (2019):      15\"\n)"

Agriculture is an important driver of growth and employer of many of the extreme poor, but it is vulnerable to disasters and productivity is low. Despite efforts to adapt, small producers remain largely excluded from modernization efforts and have not significantly benefited from economic growth. Female producers face additional challenges: they have lower access to training, capital, inputs, and markets for their goods. When women do have access to land, they have smaller plots on less fertile soil, and are less likely to produce export crops than male farmers. The Government\\x92s strategy for enhancing rural competitiveness demonstrates a multi-pronged approach focused on increasing returns to agriculture and stimulating robust supply chain participation through productive alliances. Adoption of new technologies and access to greater market intelligence to more efficiently use available resources are key components to increasing profitability and competitiveness in agriculture.

The Program\\x92s objective is to protect consumption and prevent families falling into poverty in the short run, while increasing use of health and education services. In 2014, the new Government developed a social development strategy and consolidated social programs for the poor called Platform Vida Mejor, including Bono Vida Mejor, under a new Secretary of Development and Social Inclusion. The Government seeks to expand coverage of the extreme poor, by enhancing the targeting of the Bono Vida Mejor Program while ensuring its fiscal sustainability. It has set a preliminary target of reaching 300,000 extreme poor families by 2017.

Agriculture is an important driver of growth and employer of many of the extreme poor, but it is vulnerable to disasters and productivity is low. Despite efforts to adapt, small producers remain largely excluded from modernization efforts and have not significantly benefited from economic growth. Female producers face additional challenges: they have lower access to training, <span id = \"word\">Capital</span>, inputs, and <span id = \"word\">Markets</span> for their goods. When women do have access to land, they have smaller plots on less fertile soil, and are less likely to produce export crops than male farmers. The Government\\x92s strategy for enhancing rural competitiveness demonstrates a multi-pronged approach focused on increasing returns to agriculture and stimulating robust supply chain participation through productive alliances. Adoption of new technologies and access to greater market intelligence to more efficiently use available resources are key components to increasing profitability and competitiveness in agriculture. In the context of food insecurity and high levels of malnutrition, enhancing women\\x92s participation, improving productivity, adapting to climate change, modifying the composition of its basket of products produced while introducing nutrition education are critical components for both insulating the population against exogenous shocks (such as the food crisis of 2008) and investing in modernization of the agricultural sector. . Percentage increase in volume of sales of rural producers:  Baseline (2015):  10 percent Target (2019):     60 percent\", \n\"Build crime & violence prevention capacity of local government . Crime and violence has become one of the main obstacles to development, but it is mostly preventable. According to SCD analysis, tackling crime and violence requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement and prevention through better opportunities. Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing violence, combining traditional focus on control and enforcement with a new emphasis on prevention through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the institutions responsible for implementation tend to be weak and under pressure to resort to short-term and repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake crime and violence prevention activities is paramount. WBG efforts will therefore focus on building capacity at the local level to engage on citizen security issues, with an emphasis on prevention and thus the expected outcome of this objective is enhanced government capacity to undertake crime and violence prevention..

Agriculture is an important driver of growth and employer of many of the extreme poor, but it is vulnerable to disasters and productivity is low. Despite efforts to adapt, small producers remain largely excluded from modernization efforts and have not significantly benefited from economic growth. Female producers face additional challenges: they have lower access to training, capital, inputs, and markets for their goods. When women do have access to land, they have smaller plots on less fertile soil, and are less likely to produce export crops than male farmers. The Government\\x92s strategy for enhancing rural competitiveness demonstrates a multi-pronged approach focused on increasing returns to agriculture and stimulating robust supply chain participation through productive alliances. Adoption of new technologies and access to greater market intelligence to more efficiently use available resources are key components to increasing profitability and competitiveness in agriculture. In the context of food insecurity and high levels of malnutrition, enhancing women\\x92s participation, improving productivity, adapting to climate change, modifying the composition of its basket of products produced while introducing nutrition education are critical components for both insulating the population against exogenous shocks (such as the food crisis of 2008) and investing in modernization of the agricultural sector. . Percentage increase in volume of sales of rural producers:  Baseline (2015):  10 percent Target (2019):     60 percent\", \n\"Build crime & violence prevention capacity of local government . Crime and violence has become one of the main obstacles to development, but it is mostly preventable. According to SCD analysis, tackling crime and violence requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement and prevention through better opportunities. Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing violence, combining traditional focus on control and enforcement with a new emphasis on prevention through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the institutions responsible for implementation tend to be weak and under pressure to resort to short-term and repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake crime and violence prevention activities is paramount. WBG efforts will therefore focus on building capacity at the local level to engage on citizen security issues, with an emphasis on prevention and thus the expected outcome of this objective is enhanced government capacity to undertake crime and violence prevention.. Communities implementing evidence-informed interventions that address the main risk factors affecting them: Baseline (2015):   8 Target (2019):      15\"\n)"

In 2014, the new Government developed a social development strategy and consolidated social programs for the poor called Platform Vida Mejor, including Bono Vida Mejor, under a new Secretary of Development and Social Inclusion.

Agriculture is an important driver of growth and employer of many of the extreme poor, but it is vulnerable to disasters and productivity is low. Despite efforts to adapt, small producers remain largely excluded from modernization efforts and have not significantly benefited from economic growth. Female producers face additional challenges: they have lower access to training, capital, inputs, and markets for their goods.

Crime and violence has become one of the main obstacles to development, but it is mostly preventable. According to SCD analysis, tackling crime and violence requires raising the opportunity costs of crime through increased law enforcement and prevention through better opportunities. Thus prevention should be a key component of any sustainable strategy for the promotion of citizen security and social development. This calls for capacity building for national, regional and local authorities and alignment of strategies across them as well as coordination across sectors such as health, education, and criminal justice. The Government has adopted a more comprehensive approach to reducing violence, combining traditional focus on control and enforcement with a new emphasis on prevention through the design of its flagship Safer Municipalities Program. However, the institutions responsible for implementation tend to be weak and under pressure to resort to short-term and repressive measures to show quick wins. Thus increasing capacity of local governments to undertake crime and violence prevention activities is paramount. WBG efforts will therefore focus on building capacity at the local level to engage on citizen security issues, with an emphasis on prevention and thus the expected outcome of this objective is enhanced government capacity to undertake crime and violence prevention..

The Program\\x92s objective is to protect consumption <span id = \"word\">and</span> prevent families falling into poverty in the short run, while increasing use of health <span id = \"word\">and</span> education services.

The Government seeks to exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> coverage of the extreme poor, by enhancing the targeting of the Bono Vida Mejor Program while ensuring its fiscal sustainability. It has set a preliminary target of reaching 300,000 extreme poor families by 2017.

By end 2015, the Program will begin covering students in lower secondary education (Grades 7-9), given that school dropouts tend to take place in the transition from primary (Grade 6) to lower secondary (Grade 7).  Benefits will be higher for children in lower secondary school than in primary school to reflect their higher opportunity cost <span id = \"word\">and</span> the importance of economic causes in driving the country\\x92s high dropout rates.

Given the devastating impacts of natural hazards, Honduras requires significant <span id = \"word\">Investment</span>s and continued efforts to strengthen institutions and activities aimed at enhancing resilience to <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change and natural hazards as well as addressing land degradation and deforestation. Honduras can effectively reduce risk if public expenditure can be translated into effective prevention. Deaths and damages from natural hazards can largely be mitigated and reduced when individuals and governments take proper actions and do effective pre-disaster spending. Effective risk reduction requires an institutional setup that enables subnational governments to improve the integration of hazard risk information in development planning decisions. Improving Honduras\\x92 financial response capacity in the aftermath of disasters is also critical to reduce the country\\x92s financial vulnerability to disasters while protecting its long-term fiscal balance.

Bono Vida Mejor (formerly Bono 10,000) has become the main <span id = \"word\">Social</span> assistance program in Honduras. The Program\\x92s objective is to protect consumption and prevent families falling into poverty in the short run, while increasing use of health and education services. In 2014, the new Government developed a <span id = \"word\">Social</span> development strategy and consolidated <span id = \"word\">Social</span> programs for the poor called Platform Vida Mejor, including Bono Vida Mejor, under a new Secretary of Development and <span id = \"word\">Social</span> <span id = \"word\">Inclusion</span>. The Government seeks to expand coverage of the extreme poor, by enhancing the targeting of the Bono Vida Mejor Program while ensuring its fiscal sustainability. It has set a preliminary target of reaching 300,000 extreme poor families by 2017. To this end, the Program\\x92s proxy-means test has been adjusted to ensure better identification of the extreme poor, and beneficiary data is being updated using the latest vulnerability maps from the National Statistical Institute and other poverty information. Changes are also being made to the Program\\x92s eligibility rules and benefit levels to increase coverage of excluded families in extreme poverty. By end 2015, the Program will begin covering students in lower secondary education (Grades 7-9), given that school dropouts tend to take place in the transition from primary (Grade 6) to lower secondary (Grade 7).  Benefits will be higher for children in lower secondary school than in primary school to reflect their higher opportunity cost and the importance of economic causes in driving the country\\x92s high dropout rates. Moreover, benefits will be paid according to the number of children complying with co-responsibilities, instead of a flat benefit per family. Areas with the highest rates of poverty, vulnerability, violence and high child migration will be prioritized for Program expansion, including the Corredor Seco. In line with the Government\\x92s National Financial <span id = \"word\">Inclusion</span> Strategy, and as part of strengthening implementation of the Bono Vida Mejor Program, the Government also plans to partner with at least one regulated financial institution to improve the Program\\x92s payment mechanisms. The CPF will support institutional strengthening to ensure that the CCT Program is managed more efficiently, cost effectively and transparently. The expected outcome of WBG interventions under this objective is improved coverage of the extreme poor by <span id = \"word\">Social</span> programs. .

Weaknesses in core infrastructure, especially transportation and energy, inhibit economic growth by reducing gains from trade and increasing prices for traded goods. Despite efforts to increase infrastructure coverage, Honduras still lags behind neighboring countries. Road density in Honduras is only 15 percent of Costa Ricas road density, and it lags behind Nicaragua, Panama, and El Salvador. Despite the importance of the road network, it has deteriorated due to limited public investment, environmental shocks, and weak institutional capacity within the state agencies responsible for paving <span id = \"word\">Roads</span>. In addition, high levels of crime and violence and logistical weaknesses contribute to the high costs of road transport and further exacerbate the already slow transport time. Given the significance of agriculture for both economic growth and household consumption, and due to the perishable nature of most agricultural products, improving the reliability of Honduras road network is critical for connecting producers to markets and markets to buyers and stimulating growth. Honduras also has one of the lowest rural electrification rates in LAC, with a quarter of the rural population lacking access to electricity, and high costs of power generation and unreliable power supply inhibit growth. Recognizing the important role of the private sector, the Government has already awarded several infrastructure improvement projects to private sector partners through PPP instruments. The WBG will use broad mix of interventions (knowledge and convening services, DPF, MIGA guarantees, and IFC credits) to support efforts to foster private sector involvement in Honduras transport and logistics agenda and electric power sector in order to stimulate growth. . <span id = \"word\">Roads</span> rehabilitated and/or expanded and under operation: Baseline (2015):  0  km Target (2018):     220 km \nPeople provided with <span id = \"word\">New</span> or improved access to electricity:  Baseline (2015):  0 Target (2019):     444,000"
