The Bank\\x92s program targeting sustainable <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> <span id = \"word\">Resources</span> management interventions are focused on three regions: Amazonia, Orinoquia, and the Rio Bogota watershed. This objective is also supported by interventions introducing sustainable land-use practices in cattle ranching, as well as the Sustainable Development and Green Growth DPL.   ? In the Amazon region, a priority region for biodiversity conservation and reduced deforestation which also provides opportunities for economic development for its population, Bank support will consist in fostering cross-sectoral policy coordination among sectors driving deforestation (e.g., agriculture, extractive industries, and infrastructure sectors) and on land use planning and strategies for integrated landscape management. Through GEF funding and complemented with knowledge services, the Bank will support GoC\\x92s agenda in the Amazon to strengthen governance and governmental capacity within municipalities and departments to design and implement regional plans to reduce deforestation. Through a regional program spanning Colombia, Brazil, and Peru, the Bank will support the design of an integrated, coordinated approach to the sustainable management of a significant portion of the Amazon ecosystem.  ? The <span id = \"word\">Natural</span> region of Orinoquia is often referred to as the new agricultural frontier in Colombia. While two decades ago, the land-use in the region was mainly limited to extensive cattle ranching and low-input traditional agriculture, the growing demand for food, feed, and (bio)fuels pushes modern, mechanized agriculture and associated infrastructure into one of the world\\x92s last reserves of arable land. According to the NDP, the Orinoquia region is one of the regions where country efforts will concentrate to achieve Colombia in Peace. The BioCarbon Fund Initiative for Sustainable Landscapes and related technical assistance will help strengthen territorial land management to help ensure sustainable production systems (pipeline).  ? The R\\xedo Bogot\\xe1 Environmental Recuperation and Flood Control Project seeks to transform the highly polluted river into an environmental asset for Colombia\\x92s metropolitan capital area by investing in the upgrading and expansion of the Salitre wastewater treatment plant, reducing flood risks, and creating multi-functional recreational areas along the river. The integrated water management plan for the entire Rio Bogot\\xe1 basin will aim to ensure water security for different human activities and ecosystems. .

The CPF will contribute to reducing the inter- and intra-regional gaps in terms of access and quality of basic services, with an initial strong focus on basic water and sanitation services, which may be expanded to other basic services in the future. In line with corporate objectives, it will also aim to facilitate access to finance, particularly to populations in remote areas. Through a multi-year program of lending and knowledge services, the Bank will build on its longstanding engagement on service delivery in large and mediumsized cities, and further expand its support to rural areas, including for municipalities severely impacted by armed conflict. Balancing the need to provide essential services at scale and fast while trying to develop state capacity will be a critical challenge especially in tunderserved areas. The strategy includes interventions with a strong service delivery approach in some of Colombias most disadvantaged areas, such as La Guajira department and the Pacific Coast. In addition, IFC will continue supporting Empresas Pblicas de Medellin (EPM) to improve access of low-income households to water and sewage systems. The Pacific region will be a specific target region. The NDP selected the Pacific region for priority attention given that it has the greatest economic inequality and intra-regional gaps in socioeconomic development, in response to which GoC developed Plan Todos Somos PAZcfico (Plan Pacfico).

The Bank\\x92s program targeting sustainable natural resources management interventions are focused on three regions: Amazonia, Orinoquia, and the Rio Bogota watershed. This objective is also supported by interventions introducing sustainable land-use practices in cattle ranching, as well as the Sustainable Development and Green Growth DPL.   ? In the Amazon region, a priority region for biodiversity conservation and reduced deforestation which also provides opportunities for economic development for its population, Bank support will consist in fostering cross-sectoral policy coordination among sectors driving deforestation (e.g., agriculture, extractive industries, and infrastructure sectors) and on land use planning and strategies for integrated landscape management. Through GEF funding and complemented with knowledge services, the Bank will support GoC\\x92s agenda in the Amazon to strengthen governance and governmental capacity within municipalities and departments to design and implement regional plans to reduce deforestation. Through a regional program spanning Colombia, Brazil, and Peru, the Bank will support the design of an integrated, coordinated approach to the sustainable management of a significant portion of the Amazon ecosystem.  ? The natural region of Orinoquia is often referred to as the new agricultural frontier in Colombia. While two decades ago, the land-use in the region was mainly limited to extensive cattle ranching and low-input traditional agriculture, the growing demand for food, feed, and (bio)fuels pushes modern, mechanized agriculture and associated infrastructure into one of the world\\x92s last reserves of arable land.

Colombia\\x92s prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management has been a cornerstone of its strong economic performance in recent years. However, lower oil prices have begun to put pressure on government revenues, while the post-conflict agenda will require substantial additional expenditures over the medium term. To continue complying with the fiscal rule, while addressing the spending needs of the post-conflict era, fiscal consolidation is needed in the short to medium term, including to increase non-oil tax revenue. This will require both expenditure rationalization measures and a comprehensive tax reform.

In the Amazon region, a priority region for biodiversity conservation and reduced deforestation which also provides opportunities for economic development for its population, Bank support will consist in fostering cross-sectoral policy coordination among sectors driving deforestation (e.g., agriculture, extractive industries, and infrastructure sectors) and on land use planning and strategies for integrated landscape management. Through GEF funding and complemented with knowledge services, the Bank will support GoC\\x92s agenda in the Amazon to strengthen governance and governmental capacity within municipalities and departments to design and implement regional plans to reduce deforestation. Through a regional program spanning Colombia, Brazil, and Peru, the Bank will support the design of an integrated, coordinated approach to the sustainable management of a significant portion of the Amazon ecosystem.  ? The natural region of Orinoquia is often referred to as the new agricultural frontier in Colombia. While two decades ago, the land-use in the region was mainly limited to extensive cattle ranching and low-input traditional agriculture, the growing demand for food, feed, and (bio)fuels pushes modern, mechanized agriculture and associated infrastructure into one of the world\\x92s last reserves of arable land.
