This objective is also supported by interventions introducing sustainable land-use practices in cattle ranching, as well as the Sustainable Development and Green Growth DPL.   ? In the Amazon region, a priority region for biodiversity conservation and reduced deforestation which also provides opportunities for economic development for its population, Bank support will consist in fostering cross-sectoral policy coordination among sectors driving deforestation (e.g., agriculture, extractive industries, and infrastructure sectors) and on land use planning and strategies for integrated landscape management.

The natural region of Orinoquia is often referred to as the new agricultural frontier in Colombia.
