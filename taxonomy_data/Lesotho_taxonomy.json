The development of a competitive private sector and broad-based employment incomes will have to come in large part from the rural areas, where three quarters of Lesotho population and most of the poor reside. With the decline of mining jobs and remittances, the WBG interventions will support Lesotho to generate <span id = \"word\">Self-Employment</span> by raising the productivity and returns of smallholders and MSMEs. This will spur additional demand for non-farm employment opportunities. Commercially viable smallholder agriculture is essential to increase the share of market output and to establish incentives for adopting technologies and production methods that improve yields and mitigate risks. Increased water supply in rural areas will be essential for improved irrigation. Climate change and extremes need to be mitigated.. Indicator 12: Household commercialization level in targeted agricultural areas* Baseline (2015): 64% Target (2020): 70% \n \n*Targeted districts are: Berea, Botha- Buthe, Leribe and Mafeteng.  Baseline is based on a 2015 mini-survey, and will be verified in 2016 through a comprehensive survey in targeted areas."
