In the water sector, public investments in water networks are poorly governed and performing below optimum levels with irregular service delivery to citizens.  Water sector is one of the top Government priorities where an integrated water <span id = \"word\">Management</span> approach is being developed to address issues of coverage and access as well as issues of financial and institutional sustainability.  The IBRD legacy Water Sector Investment Project is well positioned to support this priority as it includes measures to enhance water and sanitation coverage as well as efficient and sustainable <span id = \"word\">Asset</span> <span id = \"word\">Management</span>.  IBRD will support Government in its efforts towards providing additional supply capacities to address acute water shortages and to develop the proper network capacity to support this additional capacity.  Aiming at longer term sustainability of investment, IBRD will support institutional strengthening and preparation of performance monitoring and performance improvement plans.  The core indicators directly contribute to the CPF objective.  A proposed analytic work as well as the Regional Danube Water Program will provide policy support for a medium term sector financing strategy to support sustainable service delivery.
