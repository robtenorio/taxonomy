The infrastructure network in Albania is a key asset in support of <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, development initiatives <span id = \"word\">and</span> job creation.  The transport sector has a predominant share in public infrastructure investments.  It has been responsible for accruing the largest share of arrears owed by Government on capital projects reflecting ad hoc planning <span id = \"word\">and</span> budgeting of capital projects.  Addressing this issue is thus critical for supporting fiscal consolidation <span id = \"word\">and</span> PFM reforms.  Prioritization of investments in road sector, with appropriate technical feasibilities <span id = \"word\">and</span> available financial resources, is necessary to ensure that economically viable investments are selected that contribute to economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Progress has been made by Government in developing a Medium Term Budget Plan (MTBP) 2015-17 that prioritizes new transport sector investments.  The recently approved Results Based Road Safety <span id = \"word\">and</span> Maintenance Project particularly addresses this issue <span id = \"word\">and</span> aims at supporting Government efforts towards bringing fiscal discipline in transport sector investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> rebalancing the resources between new investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> asset maintenance.  The IFC Advisory <span id = \"word\">and</span> investments for Public Private Partnerships in Albania Highways complement WB engagement.

Land and property right reforms are essential for ensuring transparent and efficient management of Albania\\x92s land to promote both rural and urban investments and economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Lack of land access and an efficient land market are key obstacles for development and investment in the country.  A clear legal framework to guide a long lasting solution to property issues is still missing.  A key constraint is the incomplete registration of property and land.  The first registration of property is still in an early stage with only 10 percent of properties registered supported through an earlier World Bank assisted project.  The Government is preparing an integrated land management framework to address these constraints and has requested World Bank support.  A proposed Integrated Land Management Project will further expand property registration/digitalization and support the development of an integrated land management policy and legal framework.  It will also help in the development of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) to create a comprehensive land information service to provide users, including investors, with access to a wide range of harmonized land \\x96related information and services.  Gender and inclusion dimensions will be given a special attention.  Given the high gender gap in land ownership, administrative procedures for land formalization and property registration will incorporate measures to particularly address women\\x92s low landownership, and will be backed by public informational campaigns for greater outreach to women.  The proposed IBRD project will work with the property registration authorities to include gender disaggregated data in the government MIS system.  Progress in this area is especially critical for Albania\\x92s path to EU accession.  EU is financing a World Bank managed Land Administration Trust Fund that supports the development of the national digital registration/cadaster data improvement methodology.

Health outcomes in Albania are relatively strong by regional standards but efficiency and quality of care is poor and financial access to health services, especially of the poor and vulnerable, is a serious concern.

Government reforms in the hospital sector include creating a sound management structure, improving financial access and establishment of a health management information system to support improvement in monitoring and management for better health service quality and efficiency.  It is anticipated that specific population groups, including those with chronic diseases, will benefit from improved health care and the reduced copayments for essential, low-cost medicines.  The core indicator for measuring the achievement of this CPF objective supports the reduction of out-of-pocket payments for the poorest while the supplementary indicators will support the poor and vulnerable population through reduction in medicine prices.  The performance management and governance reforms in selected public hospitals will create greater accountability and more efficient service provision for the population.  The newly approved Health Systems Improvement Project and an IFC PPP project in health provide support in these areas, including strengthening management information systems, improving governance and financial access, and developing a PPP in the health sector.

Government reforms in the hospital sector include creating a sound management structure, improving financial access and establishment of a health management information system to support improvement in monitoring and management for better health service quality and efficiency.  It is anticipated that specific population groups, including those with chronic diseases, will benefit from improved health care and the reduced copayments for essential, low-cost medicines.  The core indicator for measuring the achievement of this CPF objective supports the reduction of out-of-pocket payments for the poorest while the supplementary indicators will support the poor and vulnerable population through reduction in medicine prices.  The performance management and governance reforms in selected public hospitals will create greater accountability and more efficient service provision for the population.  The newly approved Health Systems Improvement Project and an IFC PPP project in health provide support in these areas, including strengthening management information systems, improving governance and financial access, and developing a PPP in the health sector.  All these areas have been identified as critically important to support increased efficiency and access of health services in the hospital sector. .

The infrastructure network in Albania is a key asset in support of <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, development initiatives <span id = \"word\">and</span> job creation.  The transport sector has a predominant share in public infrastructure investments.  It has been responsible for accruing the largest share of arrears owed by Government on capital projects reflecting ad hoc planning <span id = \"word\">and</span> budgeting of capital projects.  Addressing this issue is thus critical for supporting fiscal consolidation <span id = \"word\">and</span> PFM reforms.  Prioritization of investments in road sector, with appropriate technical feasibilities <span id = \"word\">and</span> available financial resources, is necessary to ensure that economically viable investments are selected that contribute to economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Progress has been made by Government in developing a Medium Term Budget Plan (MTBP) 2015-17 that prioritizes new transport sector investments.  The recently approved Results Based Road Safety <span id = \"word\">and</span> Maintenance Project particularly addresses this issue <span id = \"word\">and</span> aims at supporting Government efforts towards bringing fiscal discipline in transport sector investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> rebalancing the resources between new investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> asset maintenance.  The IFC Advisory <span id = \"word\">and</span> investments for Public Private Partnerships in Albania Highways complement WB engagement.  Accomplishment of progress in the core indicator will contribute to enhancing transparency <span id = \"word\">and</span> predictability in managing public investments in the transport infrastructure.  A proposed Transport Reform Project will further deepen support for fiscally sustainable public investment programs.. All road sector investments are appraised for economic viability <span id = \"word\">and</span> aligned with medium term budget framework\", \n\"Contribute to improved business environment . Albania\\x92s business environment remains unattractive by global st<span id = \"word\">and</span>ards (about middle of the global rankings, with excessive bureaucracy, widespread corruption <span id = \"word\">and</span> lack of contract enforcement), <span id = \"word\">and</span> needs to improve in order to stimulate the higher level of investment needed to accelerate <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> create jobs.  Albania\\x92s current business environment is a serious constraint to <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Key areas requiring improvement include cutting the regulatory burden, strengthening the policy, legal <span id = \"word\">and</span> institutional framework for domestic <span id = \"word\">and</span> foreign investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> improving <span id = \"word\">Trade</span> logistics <span id = \"word\">and</span> facilitation.  Progress in these areas is necessary for Albania\\x92s shift towards a new <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> model <span id = \"word\">and</span> for improving the business environment.  A proposed Competitiveness <span id = \"word\">and</span> Jobs DPL will support Government\\x92s medium term reforms for improving the investment climate <span id = \"word\">and</span> exp<span id = \"word\">and</span>ing access to finance, <span id = \"word\">and</span> will provide policy support for labor market reforms <span id = \"word\">and</span> job creation.  The joint IFC <span id = \"word\">and</span> World Bank program incorporates investments, advisory services <span id = \"word\">and</span> analytic work.  IFC Debt resolution program will improve the insolvency framework to strengthen loan recovery, <span id = \"word\">and</span> enable viable businesses to rehabilitate <span id = \"word\">and</span> have further access to credit.  Low quality of labor market engagement, especially among the bottom forty percent, youth <span id = \"word\">and</span> women, is also a key constraint to inclusive <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Firms report a mismatch between job requirements <span id = \"word\">and</span> available skills.  Analytic <span id = \"word\">and</span> advisory program will build the currently inadequate evidence base on labor market issues <span id = \"word\">and</span> provide advice on priority reforms.  It will also underpin a proposed Skills <span id = \"word\">and</span> Employment Project that will enter late in the CPF period <span id = \"word\">and</span> will focus on strengthening the relevance of the training systems <span id = \"word\">and</span> active labor market programs, including enhancing linkages with employers.  Albania\\x92s performance on the Doing Business DTF measure will be used to assess progress as it reflects improvements across multiple dimensions of the business environment.  Some of the indicators for measuring the achievement of this objective will be further elaborated at the PLR stage, in line with the preparation cycle of the proposed DPL <span id = \"word\">and</span> other interventions.   . Indicator 1: Improve Doing Business Distance to Frontier (DTF)   Baseline: DB2015: 66 Target: DB2018: 74 ; Indicator 2: Increase number of firms, especially in export-oriented sectors; Target 3-5% increase in number of firms  Baseline: 111,000 firms - 2013 Target: additional 4400 - 2018\", \n\"Support sustainable tourism development. This CPF objective related to the business environment will support sustainable tourism development given its high potential as a key driver for <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, job creation, <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment. Much of Albania\\x92s <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> export potential has been linked to nature based sectors.  The country needs to take full advantage of its natural resources balancing this with sustainable development of the high potential tourism sector as a key driver for economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>. Tourism development has largely been unplanned lacking a strategic focus to develop the high tourism potential regions of the country in an integrated <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustainable manner.  The Government has given a high priority to development of sustainable tourism in the coastal region <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested WBG assistance.  A proposed Coastal Regeneration <span id = \"word\">and</span> Sustainable Tourism Project, with cross GP collaboration,  is an appropriate intervention as it has the potential to support promotion of sustainable tourism <span id = \"word\">and</span> economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> in the coastal region, while preserving the physical beauty of Albania\\x92s southern l<span id = \"word\">and</span>scape.  This operation builds upon the experience <span id = \"word\">and</span> lessons learned from a recently closed IBRD project in the coastal region.  As the proposed new operation is at an early stage of preparation, its associated indicators <span id = \"word\">and</span> targets will be incorporated at PLR time.   . Indicator 1: Key infrastructure (port, water supply, l<span id = \"word\">and</span>fill) operational in south coast for sustainable tourism Baseline: Absence of key operational infrastructure - 2012 Target: Key infrastructure operational - 2015\", \n\"Provide exp<span id = \"word\">and</span>ed <span id = \"word\">and</span> inclusive l<span id = \"word\">and</span>/property registration . L<span id = \"word\">and</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> property right reforms are essential for ensuring transparent <span id = \"word\">and</span> efficient management of Albania\\x92s l<span id = \"word\">and</span> to promote both rural <span id = \"word\">and</span> urban investments <span id = \"word\">and</span> economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Lack of l<span id = \"word\">and</span> access <span id = \"word\">and</span> an efficient l<span id = \"word\">and</span> market are key obstacles for development <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment in the country.  A clear legal framework to guide a long lasting solution to property issues is still missing.  A key constraint is the incomplete registration of property <span id = \"word\">and</span> l<span id = \"word\">and</span>.  The first registration of property is still in an early stage with only 10 percent of properties registered supported through an earlier World Bank assisted project.  The Government is preparing an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management framework to address these constraints <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested World Bank support.  A proposed Integrated L<span id = \"word\">and</span> Management Project will further exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> property registration/digitalization <span id = \"word\">and</span> support the development of an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> legal framework.  It will also help in the development of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) to create a comprehensive l<span id = \"word\">and</span> information service to provide users, including investors, with access to a wide range of harmonized l<span id = \"word\">and</span> \\x96related information <span id = \"word\">and</span> services.  Gender <span id = \"word\">and</span> inclusion dimensions will be given a special attention.  Given the high gender gap in l<span id = \"word\">and</span> ownership, administrative procedures for l<span id = \"word\">and</span> formalization <span id = \"word\">and</span> property registration will incorporate measures to particularly address women\\x92s low l<span id = \"word\">and</span>ownership, <span id = \"word\">and</span> will be backed by public informational campaigns for greater outreach to women.  The proposed IBRD project will work with the property registration authorities to include gender disaggregated data in the government MIS system.  Progress in this area is especially critical for Albania\\x92s path to EU accession.  EU is financing a World Bank managed L<span id = \"word\">and</span> Administration Trust Fund that supports the development of the national digital registration/cadaster data improvement methodology.  As the IBRD pipeline operation is under preparation, the PLR will provide more detail on the targets <span id = \"word\">and</span> baselines. Increase in percentage of properties registered in the digital registration system gender  Baseline: 10% - 2014 Target: 20% - 2019\"\n)"

This CPF objective related to the business environment will support sustainable tourism development given its high potential as a key driver for <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, job creation, <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment. Much of Albania\\x92s <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> <span id = \"word\">and</span> export potential has been linked to nature based sectors.  The country needs to take full advantage of its natural resources balancing this with sustainable development of the high potential tourism sector as a key driver for economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>. Tourism development has largely been unplanned lacking a strategic focus to develop the high tourism potential regions of the country in an integrated <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustainable manner.  The Government has given a high priority to development of sustainable tourism in the coastal region <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested WBG assistance.  A proposed Coastal Regeneration <span id = \"word\">and</span> Sustainable Tourism Project, with cross GP collaboration,  is an appropriate intervention as it has the potential to support promotion of sustainable tourism <span id = \"word\">and</span> economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span> in the coastal region, while preserving the physical beauty of Albania\\x92s southern l<span id = \"word\">and</span>scape.  This operation builds upon the experience <span id = \"word\">and</span> lessons learned from a recently closed IBRD project in the coastal region.  As the proposed new operation is at an early stage of preparation, its associated indicators <span id = \"word\">and</span> targets will be incorporated at PLR time.   . Indicator 1: Key <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span> (port, water supply, l<span id = \"word\">and</span>fill) operational in south coast for sustainable tourism Baseline: Absence of key operational <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span> - 2012 Target: Key <span id = \"word\">Infrastructure</span> operational - 2015\", \n\"Support enhanced energy security, efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> supply. Inefficiency in the energy sector is a major brake on investment <span id = \"word\">and</span> expansion of businesses in Albania.  Energy sector reforms are fundamental for sustaining <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>, improving fiscal sustainability <span id = \"word\">and</span> promoting private sector <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>.  Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.  World Bank\\x92s existing portfolio (Dam Safety Project <span id = \"word\">and</span> the Power Sector Recovery Project) is designed to directly respond to the CPF objective as it seeks to optimize generation performance, increase <span id = \"word\">and</span> diversify domestic power generation, improve distribution efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> collection rates <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve management of hydro resources.  The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> coordinating advisory work with the banks <span id = \"word\">and</span> companies involved in renewable energy projects.  WBG interventions address the key bottlenecks in the sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> will support creation of the necessary conditions for businesses to establish, grow <span id = \"word\">and</span> export more through: i) diversified domestic power generation <span id = \"word\">and</span> increased energy efficiency; <span id = \"word\">and</span> ii) improved management of hydro resources (through integrated approaches to watershed management).

Lack of l<span id = \"word\">and</span> access <span id = \"word\">and</span> an efficient l<span id = \"word\">and</span> market are key obstacles for development <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment in the country.  A clear legal framework to guide a long lasting solution to property issues is still missing.  A key constraint is the incomplete registration of property <span id = \"word\">and</span> l<span id = \"word\">and</span>.  The first registration of property is still in an early stage with only 10 percent of properties registered supported through an earlier World Bank assisted project.  The Government is preparing an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management framework to address these constraints <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested World Bank support.  A proposed Integrated L<span id = \"word\">and</span> Management Project will further exp<span id = \"word\">and</span> property registration/digitalization <span id = \"word\">and</span> support the development of an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management policy <span id = \"word\">and</span> legal framework.

The proposed IBRD project will work with the property registration authorities to include gender disaggregated data in the government MIS system.

A clear legal framework to guide a long lasting solution to property issues is still missing.  A key constraint is the incomplete registration of property <span id = \"word\">and</span> l<span id = \"word\">and</span>.  The first registration of property is still in an early stage with only 10 percent of properties registered supported through an earlier World Bank assisted project.  The Government is preparing an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management framework to address these constraints <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested World Bank support.

The country needs to take full advantage of its natural resources balancing this with sustainable development of the high potential tourism sector as a key driver for economic <span id = \"word\">Growth</span>. Tourism development has largely been unplanned lacking a strategic focus to develop the high tourism potential regions of the country in an integrated <span id = \"word\">and</span> sustainable manner.  The Government has given a high priority to development of sustainable tourism in the coastal region <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested WBG assistance.

This operation builds upon the experience <span id = \"word\">and</span> lessons learned from a recently closed IBRD project in the coastal region.  As the proposed new operation is at an early stage of preparation, its associated indicators <span id = \"word\">and</span> targets will be incorporated at PLR time.   .

Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.  World Bank\\x92s existing portfolio (Dam Safety Project <span id = \"word\">and</span> the Power Sector Recovery Project) is designed to directly respond to the CPF objective as it seeks to optimize generation performance, increase <span id = \"word\">and</span> diversify domestic power generation, improve distribution efficiency <span id = \"word\">and</span> collection rates <span id = \"word\">and</span> improve management of hydro resources.  The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> coordinating advisory work with the banks <span id = \"word\">and</span> companies involved in renewable energy projects.  WBG interventions address the key bottlenecks in the sector <span id = \"word\">and</span> will support creation of the necessary conditions for businesses to establish, grow <span id = \"word\">and</span> export more through: i) diversified domestic power generation <span id = \"word\">and</span> increased energy efficiency; <span id = \"word\">and</span> ii) improved management of hydro resources (through integrated approaches to watershed management).

Lack of l<span id = \"word\">and</span> access <span id = \"word\">and</span> an efficient l<span id = \"word\">and</span> market are key obstacles for development <span id = \"word\">and</span> investment in the country.  A clear legal framework to guide a long lasting solution to property issues is still missing.  A key constraint is the incomplete registration of property <span id = \"word\">and</span> l<span id = \"word\">and</span>.  The first registration of property is still in an early stage with only 10 percent of properties registered supported through an earlier World Bank assisted project.  The Government is preparing an integrated l<span id = \"word\">and</span> management framework to address these constraints <span id = \"word\">and</span> has requested World Bank support.

Inefficiency in the energy sector is a major brake on investment and expansion of businesses in Albania.  Energy sector reforms are fundamental for sustaining growth, improving fiscal sustainability and promoting private sector growth.  Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.

The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector and coordinating advisory work with the banks and companies involved in renewable energy projects.

No accumulation of new central government arrears and arrears backlog cleared\", \n\"Provide strengthened public investment management in transport sector . The infrastructure network in Albania is a key asset in support of growth, development initiatives and job creation.  The transport sector has a predominant share in public infrastructure investments.  It has been responsible for accruing the largest share of arrears owed by Government on capital projects reflecting ad hoc planning and budgeting of capital projects.  Addressing this issue is thus critical for supporting <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> <span id = \"word\">Consolidation</span> and PFM reforms.  Prioritization of investments in road sector, with appropriate technical feasibilities and available financial resources, is necessary to ensure that economically viable investments are selected that contribute to economic growth.  Progress has been made by Government in developing a Medium Term Budget Plan (MTBP) 2015-17 that prioritizes new transport sector investments.  The recently approved Results Based Road Safety and Maintenance Project particularly addresses this issue and aims at supporting Government efforts towards bringing <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> discipline in transport sector investments and rebalancing the resources between new investments and asset maintenance.  The IFC Advisory and investments for Public Private Partnerships in Albania Highways complement WB engagement.  Accomplishment of progress in the core indicator will contribute to enhancing transparency and predictability in managing public investments in the transport infrastructure.  A proposed Transport Reform Project will further deepen support for <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span>ly sustainable public investment programs.. All road sector investments are appraised for economic viability and aligned with medium term budget framework\", \n\"Support enhanced energy security, efficiency and supply. Inefficiency in the energy sector is a major brake on investment and expansion of businesses in Albania.  Energy sector reforms are fundamental for sustaining growth, improving <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> sustainability and promoting private sector growth.  Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.  World Bank\\x92s existing portfolio (Dam Safety Project and the Power Sector Recovery Project) is designed to directly respond to the CPF objective as it seeks to optimize generation performance, increase and diversify domestic power generation, improve distribution efficiency and collection rates and improve management of hydro resources.  The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector and coordinating advisory work with the banks and companies involved in renewable energy projects.  WBG interventions address the key bottlenecks in the sector and will support creation of the necessary conditions for businesses to establish, grow and export more through: i) diversified domestic power generation and increased energy efficiency; and ii) improved management of hydro resources (through integrated approaches to watershed management).  The core and supplementary indicators are designed to evaluate performance in these areas.  A proposed IBRD operation for Energy Sector Development, during the latter CPF period, will support further market reform and diversification and improvement of energy sources, possibly including gas diversification. Indicator 1: Electricity distribution losses are 19%  Baseline: 38% - 2014 \\nIndicator 2: Electricity customer collection rate is maintained at a sustainable average rate of 90% between 201519  Baseline: 80% - 2014; Indicator 3: The electricity market deregulation on the demand side has reached 20% of total net demand  Baseline: 9% - 2014  Target Year 2018\", \n\"Provide enhanced coverage of water and sanitation services . In the water sector, public investments in water networks are poorly governed and performing below optimum levels with irregular service delivery to citizens.  Water sector is one of the top Government priorities where an integrated water management approach is being developed to address issues of coverage and access as well as issues of financial and institutional sustainability.  The IBRD legacy Water Sector Investment Project is well positioned to support this priority as it includes measures to enhance water and sanitation coverage as well as efficient and sustainable asset management.  IBRD will support Government in its efforts towards providing additional supply capacities to address acute water shortages and to develop the proper network capacity to support this additional capacity.  Aiming at longer term sustainability of investment, IBRD will support institutional strengthening and preparation of performance monitoring and performance improvement plans.  The core indicators directly contribute to the CPF objective.  A proposed analytic work as well as the Regional Danube Water Program will provide policy support for a medium term sector financing strategy to support sustainable service delivery.

No accumulation of new central government arrears and arrears backlog cleared\", \n\"Provide strengthened public investment management in transport sector . The infrastructure network in Albania is a key asset in support of growth, development initiatives and job creation.  The transport sector has a predominant share in public infrastructure investments.  It has been responsible for accruing the largest share of arrears owed by Government on capital projects reflecting ad hoc planning and budgeting of capital projects.  Addressing this issue is thus critical for supporting <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> consolidation and PFM reforms.  Prioritization of investments in road sector, with appropriate technical feasibilities and available financial resources, is necessary to ensure that economically viable investments are selected that contribute to economic growth.  Progress has been made by Government in developing a Medium Term Budget Plan (MTBP) 2015-17 that prioritizes new transport sector investments.  The recently approved Results Based Road Safety and Maintenance Project particularly addresses this issue and aims at supporting Government efforts towards bringing <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> discipline in transport sector investments and rebalancing the resources between new investments and asset maintenance.  The IFC Advisory and investments for Public Private Partnerships in Albania Highways complement WB engagement.  Accomplishment of progress in the core indicator will contribute to enhancing transparency and predictability in managing public investments in the transport infrastructure.  A proposed Transport Reform Project will further deepen support for <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span>ly sustainable public investment programs.. All road sector investments are appraised for economic viability and aligned with medium term budget framework\", \n\"Support enhanced energy security, efficiency and supply. Inefficiency in the energy sector is a major brake on investment and expansion of businesses in Albania.  Energy sector reforms are fundamental for sustaining growth, improving <span id = \"word\">Fiscal</span> <span id = \"word\">Sustainability</span> and promoting private sector growth.  Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.  World Bank\\x92s existing portfolio (Dam Safety Project and the Power Sector Recovery Project) is designed to directly respond to the CPF objective as it seeks to optimize generation performance, increase and diversify domestic power generation, improve distribution efficiency and collection rates and improve management of hydro resources.  The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector and coordinating advisory work with the banks and companies involved in renewable energy projects.  WBG interventions address the key bottlenecks in the sector and will support creation of the necessary conditions for businesses to establish, grow and export more through: i) diversified domestic power generation and increased energy efficiency; and ii) improved management of hydro resources (through integrated approaches to watershed management).  The core and supplementary indicators are designed to evaluate performance in these areas.  A proposed IBRD operation for Energy Sector Development, during the latter CPF period, will support further market reform and diversification and improvement of energy sources, possibly including gas diversification. Indicator 1: Electricity distribution losses are 19%  Baseline: 38% - 2014 \\nIndicator 2: Electricity customer collection rate is maintained at a sustainable average rate of 90% between 201519  Baseline: 80% - 2014; Indicator 3: The electricity market deregulation on the demand side has reached 20% of total net demand  Baseline: 9% - 2014  Target Year 2018\", \n\"Provide enhanced coverage of water and sanitation services . In the water sector, public investments in water networks are poorly governed and performing below optimum levels with irregular service delivery to citizens.  Water sector is one of the top Government priorities where an integrated water management approach is being developed to address issues of coverage and access as well as issues of financial and institutional <span id = \"word\">Sustainability</span>.  The IBRD legacy Water Sector Investment Project is well positioned to support this priority as it includes measures to enhance water and sanitation coverage as well as efficient and sustainable asset management.  IBRD will support Government in its efforts towards providing additional supply capacities to address acute water shortages and to develop the proper network capacity to support this additional capacity.  Aiming at longer term <span id = \"word\">Sustainability</span> of investment, IBRD will support institutional strengthening and preparation of performance monitoring and performance improvement plans.  The core indicators directly contribute to the CPF objective.  A proposed analytic work as well as the Regional Danube Water Program will provide policy support for a medium term sector financing strategy to support sustainable service delivery. Indicator 1: Piped household water and sewer connections that are benefiting from rehabilitation works undertaken by the project  \\n \\nHousehold water connections Baseline: 0 - 2013 Target: 77,000 \\x96 2019 \\n \\nSewer connections  Baseline: 0 - 2013 Target:  3000 sewer connections - 2019\"\n)"

Inefficiency in the energy sector is a major brake on <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> and expansion of businesses in Albania.  Energy sector reforms are fundamental for sustaining growth, improving fiscal sustainability and promoting private sector growth.  Existing firms rank electricity constraints as one of the main burden of their operations (BEEPS 2013).  Reliability of power supply is essential for large firms to enter the emerging market.  World Bank\\x92s existing portfolio (Dam Safety Project and the Power Sector Recovery Project) is designed to directly respond to the CPF objective as it seeks to optimize generation performance, increase and diversify domestic power generation, improve distribution efficiency and collection rates and improve <span id = \"word\">Management</span> of hydro resources.  The IFC will work with Government to enhance the regulatory framework for renewable energy through the Balkan Renewable Energy Project, while concurrently providing indirect finance to small hydropower producers through the banking sector and coordinating advisory work with the banks and companies involved in renewable energy projects.  WBG interventions address the key bottlenecks in the sector and will support creation of the necessary conditions for businesses to establish, grow and export more through: i) diversified domestic power generation and increased energy efficiency; and ii) improved <span id = \"word\">Management</span> of hydro resources (through integrated approaches to watershed <span id = \"word\">Management</span>).  The core and supplementary indicators are designed to evaluate performance in these areas.  A proposed IBRD operation for Energy Sector Development, during the latter CPF period, will support further market reform and diversification and improvement of energy sources, possibly including gas diversification.

Health outcomes in Albania are relatively strong by regional standards but efficiency and quality of care is poor and financial access to health services, especially of the poor and vulnerable, is a serious concern.  Financial protection of households against high out-ofpocket payments (OOP) is weak.  Government reforms in the hospital sector include creating a sound <span id = \"word\">Management</span> structure, improving financial access and establishment of a health <span id = \"word\">Management</span> information system to support improvement in monitoring and <span id = \"word\">Management</span> for better health service quality and efficiency.  It is anticipated that specific population groups, including those with chronic diseases, will benefit from improved health care and the reduced copayments for essential, low-cost medicines.  The core indicator for measuring the achievement of this CPF objective supports the reduction of out-of-pocket payments for the poorest while the supplementary indicators will support the poor and vulnerable population through reduction in medicine prices.  The performance <span id = \"word\">Management</span> and governance reforms in selected <span id = \"word\">Public</span> hospitals will create greater accountability and more efficient service provision for the population.  The newly approved Health Systems Improvement Project and an IFC PPP project in health provide support in these areas, including strengthening <span id = \"word\">Management</span> information systems, improving governance and financial access, and developing a PPP in the health sector.

This CPF objective related to the business environment will support sustainable tourism development given its high potential as a key driver for growth, job creation, and investment. Much of Albanias growth and export potential has been linked to nature based sectors.  The country needs to take full advantage of its natural resources balancing this with sustainable development of the high potential tourism sector as a key driver for economic growth. Tourism development has largely been unplanned lacking a strategic focus to develop the high tourism potential regions of the country in an integrated and sustainable manner.  The Government has given a high priority to development of sustainable tourism in the coastal region and has requested WBG assistance.  A proposed Coastal Regeneration and Sustainable Tourism Project, with cross GP collaboration,  is an appropriate intervention as it has the potential to support promotion of sustainable tourism and economic growth in the coastal region, while preserving the physical beauty of Albanias southern landscape.  This operation builds upon the experience and lessons learned from a recently closed IBRD project in the coastal region.  As the proposed new operation is at an early stage of preparation, its associated indicators and targets will be incorporated at PLR time.   .

Sustained implementation of fiscal policies is required to improve efficiency of public spending at the central government level, enhance revenue measures, tackle outstanding public arrears, address sustainability of pensions, and strengthen public debt management.  Interventions with development policy operations allows the financing of an orderly medium-term fiscal consolidation which nurtures growth rather than forcing an ad hoc adjustment which would either undermine growth or require further unsustainable government borrowing on domestic markets.

The recently approved Policy Based Guarantee (a conversion of the second DPL operation), the proposed Public <span id = \"word\">Finance</span> and Growth DPLs and analytic and advisory interventions will continue to support Government efforts towards building a much needed transparency and planning in budgeting and fiscal discipline.
