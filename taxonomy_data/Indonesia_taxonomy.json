As an archipelagic nation, maritime logistics and connectivity play a critical role in driving growth, enhancing competitiveness, facilitating shared prosperity, and ensuring proper access to goods and services for all Indonesian citizens regardless of their location. For remote regions, high logistics costs help to increase their isolation and limit economic links to nearby growth poles; this in turn undermines prospects to reduce the development gap. The WBG program provides support to the GoI in addressing its connectivity challenges by outlining options and priorities to improve efficiency in national freight logistics. Specifically, the program aims to: (a) improve the quality of overall logistics policy-making through key sector interventions and policy analysis; (b) improve the countrys maritime connectivity by upgrading infrastructure, and developing recommendations for more integrated logistics solutions; and (c) reducing logistics costs via the promotion of policy reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and productivity by overcoming barriers that inhibit investment and business development in the sector.

As an archipelagic nation, maritime logistics and connectivity play a critical role in driving growth, enhancing competitiveness, facilitating shared prosperity, and ensuring proper access to goods and services for all Indonesian citizens regardless of their location. For remote regions, high logistics costs help to increase their isolation and limit economic links to nearby growth poles; this in turn undermines prospects to reduce the development gap. The WBG program provides support to the GoI in addressing its connectivity challenges by outlining options and priorities to improve efficiency in national freight logistics. Specifically, the program aims to: (a) improve the quality of overall logistics policy-making through key sector interventions and policy analysis; (b) improve the country\\x92s maritime connectivity by upgrading infrastructure, and developing recommendations for more integrated logistics solutions; and (c) reducing logistics costs via the <span id = \"word\">Promotion</span> of policy reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and productivity by overcoming barriers that inhibit <span id = \"word\">Investment</span> and business development in the sector.

This engagement will focus on supporting efforts to establish a performance-based fiscal transfer system, strengthening the capacity of central government agencies to support and oversee the performance of local governments, strengthening the back-office functions of local government to deliver local services and infrastructure, and developing tools for citizens to monitor local service delivery.  WBG financial support will focus on the gradual roll out of performance incentives in fiscal transfers to local governments for priority sectors (infrastructure, health and education). Under this pillar, IFC would help support private sector models of delivering some of the services. In several countries, including Indonesia, private sector healthcare providers (hospitals, diagnostic centers) complement the government set-up to improve the services for citizens.  WBG will seek to support such models, as well as promote other inclusive healthcare models such as e-consultations perhaps through the private sector to ramp up services especially to frontier areas. .

Ongoing and upcoming portfolio items are designed to provide multiple instruments to support government\\x92s spending better agenda. Specifically, WBG aims to help the government in the following key areas: (i) advancing energy (fuel and electricity) subsidy reforms through consistent implementation and improved transparency; (ii) improving quality of spending (allocative efficiency, effectiveness, and implementation) in key areas; (iii) improving quality of spending and service delivery of selected subnational governments; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity to modernize procurement and contract management and to improve the control environment. .

Yet it lags well behind its neighboring countries in exploiting its competitive advantage. Indonesia is missing major opportunities in this key sector because of a number of severe infrastructure, institutional and skills gaps.  WBG is proposing to support GoI with a comprehensive approach, focusing on priority hub destinations to start and later expand to more sites as part of a national tourism program. The program would draw on IBRD, IFC and MIGA resources to support the development of integrated tourism destinations, which are based on integrated master-plans and implementation strategies that are endorsed by a broad set of stakeholders. The development of integrated destinations would be via a continuous process of policy and planning coordination, and would bring together (i.e. integrate) the development of infrastructure, the promotion at the national and local levels, and skills and SME development. It would include private sector investments through IFC and MIGA financial products to support the tourism industry and to support local communities in delivering quality experiences, including SME financing and skills development needed to create a competitive tourism-based economy..
