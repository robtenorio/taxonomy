The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP).

The Agriculture Production Support Project, approved in 2012, aims to support communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and livestock species in targeted areas, and (ii) the use of Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices in climate vulnerable ecosystems.

This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening resilience to climate change.

To achieve this objective, the proposed WBG program will build on ongoing World Bank and IFC investments currently supporting agricultural productivity, adding a new regional irrigation operation, and a possible new agricultural productivity operation.   The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP). Thirdly, the <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> of agricultural production will be strengthened through support for improved land and water management, as measured by additional land area under Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices. \nThe criteria that shape the existing agriculture portfolio in Chad stem from the FY04-06 CAS and the 2010-2012 ISN, which included a focus on improving the effective usage of oil revenues as well as the development of non-oil economic opportunities. The Agriculture Production Support Project, approved in 2012, aims to support communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and livestock species in targeted areas, and (ii) the use of Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices in <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> vulnerable ecosystems.  The regions targeted by the project focus on high-potential zones in which significant production increases are deemed possible, and in which food security and poverty challenges are high. The spatial targeting was influenced as well by the matrix of donor interventions established to help ensure good coordination between the various projects in the country. To ensure that environmental activities are fully blended with productive investments, support for SLWM practices focuses on the same regions and is expected to have a demonstration effect for other regions.  This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> to <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change. To help define this integrated approach, crosssectoral analytical work will be undertaken to form the basis of the next generation of WBG support for agricultural production in Chad, focusing on constraints to investment in agricultural productivity, including land rights and conflicts.

Ongoing technical assistance includes support for capacity building in public financial management including procurement reform, and transparency through engagement with civil society organizations. This will be supplemented with further technical assistance for (i) a repeat PEFA assessment during the CPF period to guide the direction of PFM reforms, and (ii) information about budgetary allocations at a local level, complemented on the analytical side with an assessment of local capacity for the provision of services, project implementation, participatory budgeting, and the redress of grievances. There are three expected outcomes of this objective.  WBG support will lead to more effective financial management, as measured by a reduction in the share of domestically <span id = \"word\">Finance</span>d spending executed through extraordinary budget procedures, and a reduction in the stock of public expenditure arrears as a percentage of total public expenditure. This will be accompanied by greater transparency as measured (either formally under the PEFA Secretariat or by the WBG) by the PEFA Indicator 5 (PEFA PI-5) rating of published budget documentation. The main on-going WBG intervention in the area of public resource management is the Public Financial Management Capacity Building Project (P090265). Effective from April 2009 the project aims to improve the quality of Chads PFM system to increase the efficient and transparent use of public resources, in particular oil revenue.  This was in line with the core intervention logic set out in the FY04-06 CAS. The project has been supplemented by technical assistance for capacity building in national statistics, PFM systems and support to the Government in preparing for HIPC.  Knowledge gaps identified in the SCD to be addressed under this objective include high quality information on poverty dynamics, which will be addressed through consumption surveys, with a strong focus on the agricultural sector, complemented by IT-based, higher frequency light surveys. \n \n .

Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> to <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change. To help define this integrated approach, crosssectoral analytical work will be undertaken to form the basis of the next generation of WBG support for agricultural production in Chad, focusing on constraints to investment in agricultural productivity, including land rights and conflicts.

This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for <span id = \"word\">Water</span>-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved <span id = \"word\">Water</span> management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective <span id = \"word\">Transboundary</span> management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening resilience to climate change. To help define this integrated approach, crosssectoral analytical work will be undertaken to form the basis of the next generation of WBG support for agricultural production in Chad, focusing on constraints to investment in agricultural productivity, including land rights and conflicts.
