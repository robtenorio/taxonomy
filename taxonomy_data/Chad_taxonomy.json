To achieve this objective, the proposed WBG program will build on ongoing World Bank and IFC investments currently supporting agricultural productivity, adding a new regional irrigation operation, and a possible new agricultural productivity operation.   The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP).

The Agriculture Production Support Project, approved in 2012, aims to support communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and livestock species in targeted areas, and (ii) the use of Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices in climate vulnerable ecosystems.

This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.

Indicator 2.1.1 Volume of production of sorghum, millet, maize and rice by beneficiaries in targeted regions (tons) Baseline: 759,800  Target: 905,900 (2017) \\nIndicator 2.1.2 Herd prevalence of CBPP and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of SRP (percent) Baseline: 80 (CBPP) 30 (SRP) Target: 50 (CBPP) 45 (SRP) (2019) \\nIndicator 2.1.3 Additional area (ha) under SLWM practices  Baseline: 0  Target: 6000 (2017)\", \n\"More productive and resilient agriculture . To achieve this objective, the proposed WBG program will build on ongoing World Bank and IFC investments currently supporting agricultural productivity, adding a new regional irrigation operation, and a possible new agricultural productivity operation.   The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP). Thirdly, the resilience of agricultural production will be strengthened through support for improved land and water management, as measured by additional land area under Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices. \\nThe criteria that shape the existing agriculture portfolio in Chad stem from the FY04-06 CAS and the 2010-2012 ISN, which included a focus on improving the effective usage of oil revenues as well as the development of non-oil economic opportunities. The Agriculture Production Support Project, approved in 2012, aims to support communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and <span id = \"word\">Livestock</span> species in targeted areas, and (ii) the use of Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices in climate vulnerable ecosystems.  The regions targeted by the project focus on high-potential zones in which significant production increases are deemed possible, and in which food security and poverty challenges are high. The spatial targeting was influenced as well by the matrix of donor interventions established to help ensure good coordination between the various projects in the country. To ensure that environmental activities are fully blended with productive investments, support for SLWM practices focuses on the same regions and is expected to have a demonstration effect for other regions.  This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBG\\x92s approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and <span id = \"word\">Livestock</span>; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The program\\x92s support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening resilience to climate change. To help define this integrated approach, crosssectoral analytical work will be undertaken to form the basis of the next generation of WBG support for agricultural production in Chad, focusing on constraints to investment in agricultural productivity, including land rights and conflicts.

To achieve this objective, the proposed WBG program will build on ongoing World Bank and IFC investments currently supporting agricultural productivity, adding a new regional irrigation operation, and a possible new agricultural productivity operation.   The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP). Thirdly, the <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> of agricultural production will be strengthened through support for improved land and water management, as measured by additional land area under Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices. \nThe criteria that shape the existing agriculture portfolio in Chad stem from the FY04-06 CAS and the 2010-2012 ISN, which included a focus on improving the effective usage of oil revenues as well as the development of non-oil economic opportunities. The Agriculture Production Support Project, approved in 2012, aims to support communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and livestock species in targeted areas, and (ii) the use of Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM) practices in <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> vulnerable ecosystems.  The regions targeted by the project focus on high-potential zones in which significant production increases are deemed possible, and in which food security and poverty challenges are high. The spatial targeting was influenced as well by the matrix of donor interventions established to help ensure good coordination between the various projects in the country. To ensure that environmental activities are fully blended with productive investments, support for SLWM practices focuses on the same regions and is expected to have a demonstration effect for other regions.  This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> to <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change. To help define this integrated approach, crosssectoral analytical work will be undertaken to form the basis of the next generation of WBG support for agricultural production in Chad, focusing on constraints to investment in agricultural productivity, including land rights and conflicts.

To achieve this objective, the WBG program will include ongoing operations in education and women\\x92s empowerment, combined with possible new investment in TVET and post-basic skills.  The expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of improving access to and the quality of education in rural areas, with a particular emphasis on girls\\x92 education. This is captured by the gender-disaggregated primary completion rate in targeted regions, which reflects aspects of both access and quality, and the girls\\x92 secondary school drop-out rate.  As the regions targeted by the Education Sector Reform Project are predominantly rural, indicators of its outcomes reflect an improvement in access and quality in rural areas. Key criteria that underpin the WBG\\x92s approach include a strong focus on access to basic services for women and girls, working through local communities and actors, especially in education.  The Education Sector Reform Project Phase 2 became effective in 2014 and aims to improve teaching and learning conditions in primary and upper secondary education in selected areas, and to strengthen evidence-based decision making in the education sector. The Sahel Women\\x92s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDE) Project includes support for designing, financing and evaluating country <span id = \"word\">Programs</span> in women and girls empowerment, which will capitalize on the law adopted in 2015 establishing eighteen years as the minimum age for marriage, aiming to protect girls and promote their education. The portfolio also includes ASA work aimed at building the knowledge base for education, and IFC investment in domestic capacity to produce learning materials.  These operations will be complemented with a possible post-basic skills project, to help address the skills gap for agricultural productivity and increased domestic transformation. .

To achieve this objective, the WBG program will include technical assistance accompanied by possible DPOs.  Ongoing technical assistance includes support for capacity building in public financial management including procurement reform, <span id = \"word\">and</span> transparency through engagement with civil society organizations. This will be supplemented with further technical assistance for (i) a repeat PEFA assessment during the CPF period to guide the direction of PFM reforms, <span id = \"word\">and</span> (ii) information about budgetary allocations at a local level, complemented on the analytical side with an assessment of local capacity for the provision of services, project implementation, participatory budgeting, <span id = \"word\">and</span> the redress of grievances. There are three expected outcomes of this objective.  WBG support will lead to more effective financial management, as measured by a reduction in the share of domestically <span id = \"word\">Finance</span>d spending executed through extraordinary budget procedures, <span id = \"word\">and</span> a reduction in the stock of public expenditure arrears as a percentage of total public expenditure. This will be accompanied by greater transparency as measured (either formally under the PEFA Secretariat or by the WBG) by the PEFA Indicator 5 (PEFA PI-5) rating of published budget documentation. The main on-going WBG intervention in the area of public resource management is the Public Financial Management Capacity Building Project (P090265). Effective from April 2009 the project aims to improve the quality of Chad\\x92s PFM system to increase the efficient <span id = \"word\">and</span> transparent use of public resources, in particular oil revenue.  This was in line with the core intervention logic set out in the FY04-06 CAS.

The expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of improving access to and the quality of education in rural areas, with a particular emphasis on girls education. This is captured by the gender-disaggregated primary completion rate in targeted regions, which reflects aspects of both access and quality, and the girls secondary school drop-out rate.  As the regions targeted by the Education Sector Reform Project are predominantly rural, indicators of its outcomes reflect an improvement in access and quality in rural areas. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach include a strong focus on access to basic services for women and girls, working through local communities and actors, especially in education.  The Education Sector Reform Project Phase 2 became effective in 2014 and aims to improve teaching and learning conditions in primary and upper secondary education in selected areas, and to strengthen evidence-based decision making in the education sector. The Sahel Womens Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDE) Project includes support for designing, financing and evaluating country programs in women and girls empowerment, which will capitalize on the law adopted in 2015 establishing eighteen years as the minimum age for marriage, aiming to protect girls and promote their education. The portfolio also includes ASA work aimed at building the knowledge base for education, and IFC investment in domestic capacity to produce learning materials.  These operations will be complemented with a possible post-basic skills project, to help address the skills gap for agricultural productivity and increased domestic transformation. .

The three expected outcomes of this objective reflect the goal of enhancing resilient agricultural productivity. First, WBG support will lead to increased production of the principal cereal crops (sorghum, millet, maize and rice) in targeted regions, and second, it will reduce herd prevalence of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and post-vaccinal seroprevalence of small ruminant plague (SRP).

The regions targeted by the project focus on high-potential zones in which significant production increases are deemed possible, and in which food security and poverty challenges are high. The spatial targeting was influenced as well by the matrix of donor interventions established to help ensure good coordination between the various projects in the country. To ensure that environmental activities are fully blended with productive investments, support for SLWM practices focuses on the same regions and is expected to have a demonstration effect for other regions.  This support is further complemented by IFC investment in construction services for water-well drilling, drainage, and environmental management. Key criteria that underpin the WBGs approach for the FY16-20 period include: (i) prioritisation of cereal crops and livestock; (ii) an integrated approach to productivity, value chains and market access; and (iii) the need to continue to work at community and local levels to strengthen accountability. The programs support for improved water management will be reinforced through the regional irrigation operation currently under preparation, together with regional technical assistance for the Lake Chad dialogue, which will focus on the effective transboundary management of this key resource.  As ongoing operations mature, a possible new agricultural productivity project will seek to further support an integrated approach to agricultural productivity and value chains, as well as further strengthening <span id = \"word\">Resilience</span> to <span id = \"word\">Climate</span> change.
